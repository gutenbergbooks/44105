<h2 id="c1"><br />THE STORY OF
<br />NOUREDDIN AND THE FAIR PERSIAN.</h2>
<p>Balsora was for many years the capital of a kingdom
tributary to the caliphs of Arabia. The king
who governed it in the days of caliph Haroun Alraschid
was named Zinchi. They were both cousins,
the sons of two brothers. Zinchi not thinking it
proper to commit the administration of his affairs to
one single vizier, made choice of two, Khacan and
Saouy.</p>
<p>Khacan was of a sweet, generous, and affable
temper, and took a wonderful pride in obliging those
with whom he had any concern, to the utmost of his
power, without the least hinderance or prejudice to
justice, whenever it was demanded of him; so that
he was universally respected both at court, in the
city, and throughout the whole kingdom; and every
body&rsquo;s mouth was full of the praises he so highly deserved.</p>
<p>Saouy was of a quite different character: he was
always sullen and morose, and treated every body
after a disrespectful manner, without any regard to
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
their rank or quality; instead of making himself beloved
and admired for his riches, he was so perfect a
miser, as to deny himself the necessaries of life. In
short, nobody could endure him; and if ever any thing
was said of him, to be sure it was something of ill.
But what increased the people&rsquo;s hatred against him
the more was his implacable aversion for Khacan;
always interpreting in the worst sense the actions of
that worthy minister, and endeavouring to do him all
the ill offices imaginable with the king.</p>
<p>One day, after council, the king of Balsora diverted
himself with his two viziers, and some other members
of the council: they fell into discourse about
the women slaves, that with us are daily bought and
sold, and are almost reckoned in the same rank with
our wives. Some were of opinion, that it was
enough if the slave that one bought was beautiful
and well shaped, to make us amends for the wives,
which, very often, upon the account of alliance or
interest in families, we are forced to marry, who are
not always the greatest beauties, nor mistresses of
any perfection, either of mind or body. Others
maintained, and amongst the rest Khacan, that neither
beauty, nor a thousand other charming perfections
of the body, were the only things to be coveted
in a mistress; but they ought to be accompanied with
a great deal of wit, prudence, modesty, and agreeableness;
and, if possible, abundance of sense and
penetration. The reason they gave for it was, that
nothing in the world could be more agreeable to
persons on whom the management of important
affairs depend, than, after having spent the day
in that fatiguing employment, to have a companion
in their retirement whose conversation is not only
agreeable, but useful and diverting; for, in short,
continued they, there is but little difference between
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
brutes and those men who keep a mistress only to
look upon her, and gratify a passion that we have in
common with them.</p>
<p>The king was entirely of their opinion who spoke
last, and he quickly gave some demonstration of it,
by ordering Khacan to buy him a slave, one that was
a perfect beauty, mistress of all those qualifications
they had just mentioned, and especially very ingenious.</p>
<p>Saouy, jealous of the honour the king had done
Khacan, and vexed at his being of a contrary opinion,
Sir, says he, it will be very difficult to find a
slave so accomplished as to answer your majesty&rsquo;s
demand; and, should they light upon such a one,
(as I scarce believe they will,) she will be a cheap
bargain at ten thousand pieces of gold. Saouy, replied
the king, I perceive plainly you think it too
great a sum: it may be so for you, though not for
me. Then turning to the chief treasurer, he ordered
him to send the ten thousand pieces of gold to the
vizier&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Khacan, as soon as he came home, sent for all the
courtiers who used to deal in women slaves, and
strictly charged them, that, if ever they met with a
slave that answered the description he gave them,
they should come and acquaint him with it. The
courtiers, partly to oblige the vizier, and partly for
their own interest, promised to use their utmost endeavours
to find out one to his liking. Accordingly
there was scarce a day past but they brought him
one, yet he always found some fault or other with
them.</p>
<p>One day as Khacan was getting on horseback
very early in the morning to go to court, a courtier
came to him, and, with a great deal of eagerness,
catching hold of the stirrup, told him there was a
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
Persian merchant arrived very late the day before,
who had a slave to sell so surprisingly beautiful, that
she excelled all women that his eyes ever beheld;
and, as for her parts and learning, the merchant engaged
she could cope with the finest wits and the
most knowing persons of the age.</p>
<p>Khacan, overjoyed at this news, which made him
hope for a favourable reception at court, ordered him
to bring the slave to his palace against his coming
back, and so continued his journey.</p>
<p>The courtier failed not of being at the vizier&rsquo;s at
the appointed hour; and Khacan, finding the lovely
slave so much beyond his expectation, immediately
gave her the name of the Fair Persian. As she had
an infinite deal of wit and learning, he soon perceived
by her conversation that it was in vain to search any
farther for a slave that surpassed her in any of those
qualifications required by the king, and therefore he
asked the courtier at what rate the Persian merchant
valued her.</p>
<p>Sir, replied the courtier, he is a man of few words
in bargaining, and he tells me, that the very lowest
rate he can part with her at, is ten thousand pieces
of gold: he has also sworn to me, that without
reckoning his pains and trouble from the time of his
first taking care of her, he has laid out pretty near
the sum upon her education, on masters to instruct
and teach her, besides clothes and maintenance;
and, as he always thought her fit for a king, so from
her very infancy, in which he bought her, he has not
been sparing in any thing that might contribute towards
advancing her to that high honour. She plays
on all sorts of instruments to perfection, she dances,
sings, writes better than the most celebrated authors,
understands poetry; and, in short, there is
scarce any book but what she has read; so that
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
there never was a slave of so vast a capacity heard of
before.</p>
<p>The vizier Khacan, who understood the merit of
the Fair Persian better than the courtier, that only
reported what he had heard from the merchant, was
unwilling to drive off the bargain to another time;
and therefore he sent one of his servants to look after
the merchant, where the courtier told him he was to
be found.</p>
<p>As soon as the Persian merchant came, It is not
for myself, but the king, says the vizier Khacan, that
I buy your slave; but, however, you must let him
have her at a more reasonable price than what you
have already set upon her.</p>
<p>Sir, replied the merchant, I should do myself an
unspeakable honour in offering her as a present to
his majesty, were I able to make him one of so inestimable
a value. I barely ask no more than what
her education and breeding up has cost me; and all
I have to say is, that I believe his majesty will be
extremely pleased with the purchase.</p>
<p>The vizier Khacan would stand no longer bargaining
with the merchant, but paid him the money down
immediately. Sir, says he to the vizier, upon taking
his leave of him, since the slave is designed for
the king&rsquo;s use, give me leave to tell you, that being
extremely fatigued with our long journey together,
you see her at a great disadvantage; and though she
has not her equal in the world for beauty, yet if you
please to keep her at your own house but for a fortnight,
and strive a little to please and humour her,
she will appear quite another creature: after that,
you may present her to the king with abundance of
honour and credit; for which, I doubt not but you
will think yourself much obliged to me. The sun,
you see, has a little tarnished her complexion; but
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
after two or three times bathing, and when you have
dressed her according to the fashion of your country,
she will appear to your eyes infinitely more charming
than now.</p>
<p>Khacan was mightily pleased with the advice the
merchant gave him, and was resolved to follow it.
Accordingly the Fair Persian was lodged in a particular
apartment near his lady&rsquo;s, whom he desired to
invite her to an entertainment, and henceforth to
treat her as a mistress designed for the king: he
also entreated his lady to get the richest clothes for
her that possibly could be had, and especially those
that became her best. Before he took his leave of
the Fair Persian, he says, Your happiness, madam,
cannot be greater than what I am about to procure
for you, since it is for the king himself I have bought
you; and I hope he will be better pleased with the
enjoyment of you, than I am in discharging the trust
his majesty has laid upon me: however, I think it
my duty to warn you of my son, who, though he has
a tolerable share of wit, yet is a young, wanton, forward
youth; and therefore have a care how you suffer
him to come near you. The Fair Persian thanked
him for his good advice; and after she had given him
an assurance of her intention to follow it, he withdrew.</p>
<p>Noureddin, for so the vizier&rsquo;s son was named,
had all the liberty imaginable in his mother&rsquo;s apartment,
with whom he usually ate: he was very genteel,
young, agreeable, and bold; and being master
of abundance of wit and readiness of expression, he
had the art of persuading people to whatever he
pleased. He saw the Fair Persian; and from their
first interview, though he knew his father had bought
her purposely for the king, and he himself had declared
the same, yet he never used the least endeavour
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
to put a stop to the violence of his passion. In
short, he resigned himself wholly to the power of her
charms, by which his heart was at first conquered:
and being ravished with her conversation, he was
resolved to employ his utmost endeavours to get her
from the king.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Fair Persian had no dislike
to Noureddin. The vizier, says she to herself,
has done me a particular honour in buying me for
the king of Balsora; but I should have thought myself
very happy if he had designed me only for his
son.</p>
<p>Noureddin was not backward in making use of the
advantage of seeing, entertaining, and conversing
with a beauty he was so passionately in love with;
for he would never leave her until his mother forced
him to do it. My son, she would say, it is not proper
for a young man, as you are, to be always
amongst the ladies; go mind your studies, that in
time you may be worthy to succeed your father in
his high posts and honours.</p>
<p>It being a great while since the Fair Persian had
bathed, on account of her late fatiguing journey, the
vizier&rsquo;s lady, five or six days after she was bought,
ordered a private bath in her own house to be got
ready purposely for her. She had a great many
women slaves to wait upon her, who were charged
by the vizier&rsquo;s lady, to be as careful of her as of her
own person, and, after bathing, to put on her a very
rich suit of clothes that she had provided for her;
and all this pains and care was taken purely to ingratiate
herself the more into her husband&rsquo;s affection, by
letting him see how much she concerned herself in
every thing that contributed to his pleasure.</p>
<p>As soon as she came out of the bath, the Fair Persian,
a thousand times more beautiful than ever she
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
appeared to Khacan when he bought her, went to
make a visit to his lady, who at first sight hardly
knew her. After having saluted her in a very graceful
manner, Madam, says she, I know not how you
like me in this dress you have been pleased to order
for me; but your women, who tell me it becomes me
so extremely well they should scarce know me, are
such gross flatterers, that it is from you alone I expect
to hear the truth: but, however, if what they
say be really so, it is to you entirely, madam, that I
owe the advantage it has given me.</p>
<p>Oh! my daughter, cries the vizier&rsquo;s lady, quite
transported with joy, you have no reason in the
world to believe my women have flattered you: I
am better skilled in beauty than they are; and, setting
aside your dress, which becomes you admirably
well, you appear so much handsomer than you did
before your bathing, that I hardly knew you myself:
if I thought the bath was yet hot enough, I would
willingly take my turn, for I am now of an age that
requires frequent use of it. Madam, replies the Fair
Persian, I have nothing to say to the undeserved
civilities you have been pleased to show me; but, as
for the bath, it is wonderfully fine; and if you design
to go in, you must be quick, for there is no time to
be lost, as your women can inform you as well as I.</p>
<p>The vizier&rsquo;s lady, considering that she had not
bathed for some days past, was willing to make use
of that opportunity; and accordingly she acquainted
her women with her intention, who immediately
prepared all things necessary on such an occasion.
The Fair Persian withdrew to her apartment; and
the vizier&rsquo;s lady, before she went to bathe, ordered
two little slaves to stay with her, with a strict charge,
that if Noureddin came they should not give him admittance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>While the vizier&rsquo;s lady was bathing, and the fair
slave alone in her apartment, in came Noureddin,
and not finding his mother in her chamber, went
directly to the Fair Persian&rsquo;s, where he found the
two little slaves in the antechamber: he asked them
where his mother was. They told him, in the bath.
Where is the Fair Persian, then? replied Noureddin.
In her chamber, answered the slaves; but we have
positive orders from your mother not to let you go in.</p>
<p>The entrance into the Fair Persian&rsquo;s chamber being
only covered with a piece of tapestry, Noureddin
went to lift it up in order to go in, but was opposed
by the two slaves, who clapped themselves just before
it on purpose to stop his passage: he presently
caught hold of both their arms, and thrusting them
out of the antechamber, locked the door upon them.
Away they immediately ran with a great outcry to
the bath, and with weeping eyes told their lady that
Noureddin, having driven them away by force, had
got into the Fair Persian&rsquo;s chamber.</p>
<p>The vizier&rsquo;s lady received the astonishing news of
her son&rsquo;s presumption with the greatest concern that
could be: she immediately left off bathing, and
dressing herself with all possible speed, came directly
to the Fair Persian&rsquo;s chamber; but before she
could get thither, Noureddin was fairly marched off.</p>
<p>The Fair Persian was extremely surprised to see
the vizier&rsquo;s lady enter her chamber all in tears, and
in the utmost confusion imaginable: Madam, says
she to her, may I presume to ask you the occasion of
your concern; and what accident has happened in the
bath, that makes you leave it so soon?</p>
<p>What! cries the vizier&rsquo;s lady, can you so calmly
ask that question, after your entertaining my son
Noureddin alone in your chamber? or can there happen
a greater misfortune either to him or me?</p>
<p>I beseech you, madam, says the fair slave, what
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
injury can this action of Noureddin&rsquo;s do either to you
or him?</p>
<p>How! replied the vizier&rsquo;s lady, did not my husband
tell you that you were designed for the king,
and sufficiently caution you to have a care of Noureddin?</p>
<p>I have not forgot it, madam, replied the Fair Persian;
but your son came to tell me the vizier his
father had changed his mind, and, instead of reserving
me for the king, as he first designed, has
made him a present of my person. I easily believed
him, madam; for oh! think how a slave as I am,
accustomed from my infant years to the bonds of servitude,
could have the heart and power to resist
him! I must own I did it with the less unwillingness
on account of a violent passion for him, which the
freedom of conversation, and seeing one another
daily, has raised in my soul. I could freely lose the
hopes of ever being the king&rsquo;s, and think myself the
happiest of creatures in spending my whole life with
Noureddin.</p>
<p>At this discourse of the Fair Persian&rsquo;s, Would to
God, cries the vizier&rsquo;s lady, that what you say were
true! for then I should have no reason to be concerned:
but, believe me, Noureddin is an impostor,
and you are deceived; for it is impossible his father
should ever make him the present you spoke of. Ah!
wretched youth, how miserable hast thou made me,
but more thy father, by the dismal consequences we
must all expect to share with him! Neither my
prayers nor tears will be able to prevail, or obtain a
pardon for him; but, as soon as his father hears
of his violence to you, he will inevitably sacrifice him
to his just resentment. At the end of these words
she fell a-weeping bitterly; and the slaves, who had
as tender a regard for Noureddin as herself, bore her
company.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>A little after this, in came the vizier Khacan;
and being mightily surprised to find his lady and her
slaves all in tears, and the Fair Persian very melancholy,
asked the reason of it; but they, instead of
answering him, kept on weeping and making hideous
lamentations. He was more astonished at this than
he was before; at last, addressing himself to his
wife, I command you, says he, to let me know the
occasion of your tears, and to tell me the whole truth
of the matter.</p>
<p>The poor disconsolate lady being forced to satisfy
her husband, Sir, says she, you shall first promise
not to use me unkindly upon the discovery of what
you are desirous to know, since I tell you beforehand
that what has happened has not been occasioned by
any fault of mine. While I was bathing with my
women, continued she, your son, laying hold of that
fatal opportunity to ruin us both, came hither, and
made the Fair Persian believe that, instead of reserving
her for the king, as you once designed, you
had given her to him as a present: I do not say he
has done this out of any ill design, but shall leave
you to judge of it yourself. It is upon your account,
and his, for whom I want confidence to implore your
pardon, that I am so extremely concerned.</p>
<p>It is impossible to express the vizier Khacan&rsquo;s
distraction upon the hearing of the insolence of
his son Noureddin: Ah! cried he, beating his
breast, and tearing his beard, Miserable son! unworthy
of life! hast thou at last thrown thy father
from the highest pinnacle of happiness into a misfortune
that must inevitably involve thee also in its
ruin? Neither will the king be satisfied with thy
blood nor mine, but will revenge himself after a more
severe manner for the affront offered to his royal
person.</p>
<p>His lady used her utmost endeavours to comfort
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
and assuage his sorrow. Concern yourself no more
about the matter, my dear, said she; I will sell part
of my jewels for ten thousand pieces of gold, with
which you may buy another slave, handsomer, and
more agreeable to the king&rsquo;s fancy than this.</p>
<p>Ah! replied the vizier, could you think me of so
mean a spirit, as to be so extremely afflicted at the
losing ten thousand pieces of gold? It is not that,
nor the loss of all my goods, which I can easily part
with; but the forfeiting of my honour, more precious
than all the riches in the world, that torments and
touches me so nearly. However, methinks, replied
the lady, this can be no very considerable damage,
since it is in the power of money to repair it.</p>
<p>How! cried the vizier, you know Saouy is my
mortal enemy; and as soon as this affair comes to
his knowledge, do you think he will not insult over
me, and mock my misfortunes before the king? Your
majesty, he will say to him, is always talking of
Khacan&rsquo;s zeal and affection for your service: but see
what a proof he has lately given of his being worthy
the respect you have hitherto shown him. He has
received ten thousand pieces of gold to buy a slave
with; and, to do him justice, he has honourably performed
that commission, in buying the most beautiful
that ever eyes beheld; but, instead of bringing her
to your majesty, he has thought it better to make a
present of her to his son: Here, my son, said he,
take this slave, since thou art more worthy of her
than the king. Then, with his usual malice, will he
go on: His son has her now entirely in his possession,
and every day revels in her arms, without the
least disturbance: this, sir, is the whole truth of the
matter, that I have done myself the honour of acquainting
you with; and if your majesty questions
the truth of it, you may easily satisfy yourself. Do
you not plainly see, my dear, continued the vizier,
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
how, upon such a malicious insinuation as this, I am
every moment liable to have my house forced open by
the king&rsquo;s guards, and the Fair Persian taken from
me, besides a thousand other misfortunes that will
unavoidably follow? Sir, said the vizier&rsquo;s lady to her
husband, after he had finished his discourse, I am
sensible the malice of Saouy is very great, and that,
if he has had but the least intimation of this affair,
he will certainly give it a turn very disadvantageous
to your interest: but how is it possible that he or any
body else should come to the knowledge of what has
been privately transacted in your family? Suppose it
comes to the king&rsquo;s ear, and he should ask you about
it, cannot you say, that upon strict examination, you
did not think the slave so fit for his majesty&rsquo;s use as
you did at the first view; that the merchant has
cheated you; that, indeed, she has a great deal of
beauty, but is nothing near so witty or agreeable as
she was reported to be? The king will certainly believe
what you say, and Saouy be vexed to the soul
to see all his malicious designs of ruining you eternally
disappointed. Take courage, then, and, if you
will follow my advice, send for all the courtiers, tell
them you do not like the Fair Persian, and order them
to be as expeditious as possible in getting another
slave.</p>
<p>The vizier Khacan, highly approving of this advice,
was resolved to make use of it; and though his
passion began to cool a little, yet his indignation
against his son Noureddin was not in the least
abated.</p>
<p>Noureddin came not in sight all that day; and,
not daring to hide himself among his companions,
lest his father should search their houses for him, he
went a little way out of town, and took sanctuary in
a garden where he had never been before, and where
his person was utterly unknown. It was very late
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
when he came back, being willing to stay till his
father was a-bed, and then his mother&rsquo;s women opening
the door very softly, let him in without any manner
of noise. The next morning he went out before
his father was stirring; and thus for a whole month
was he put to his shifts, which was a terrible mortification
to him. Indeed the women never flattered
him, but told him plainly his father&rsquo;s anger was as
great as ever, and if he came in his sight he would
certainly kill him.</p>
<p>Though the vizier&rsquo;s lady was informed by her women
of Noureddin&rsquo;s lying every night in the house,
yet she durst not presume to entreat her husband to
pardon him. At last, one day, says she to him; I
have hitherto been silent, not daring to take the
liberty of talking to you about your son; but now
give me leave to ask you what you design to do with
him. Indeed it is impossible for a son to be more
criminal towards a father than Noureddin has been
towards you; he has robbed you of the honour and
satisfaction of presenting the king with a slave so
accomplished as the Fair Persian: but, after all, are
you absolutely resolved to destroy him; and, instead
of a light evil, draw upon yourself a far greater than
perhaps you imagine at present? Are you not afraid
that the world, which spitefully inquires after the
reason of your son&rsquo;s absconding, should find out the
true cause which you are so desirous of keeping secret?
and if that should happen, you would justly fall
into a misfortune which it is so much your interest
to avoid.</p>
<p>Madam, said the vizier, there is abundance of
sound reasoning in what you have urged: however,
I cannot think of pardoning Noureddin till I have
humbled him a little more. He shall be sufficiently
mortified, replied the lady, if you will put in execution
what is just come into my mind. You must know,
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
then, your son comes hither every night after you are
a-bed; he lies here, and steals out every morning before
you are stirring: you shall wait for his coming in
to-night; make as if you designed to kill him; upon
which I will run to his assistance, and when he finds
his life entirely owing to my prayers and entreaties,
you may oblige him to take the Fair Persian on
what condition soever you please. He loves her,
and I am sensible the fair slave has no aversion for
him.</p>
<p>Khacan was very willing to make use of this stratagem:
so, when Noureddin came at the usual hour,
before the door was opened, he placed himself behind
it: as soon as ever he entered, he rushed suddenly
upon him, and got him down under his feet. Noureddin,
lifting up his head, saw his father with a dagger
in his hand, ready prepared to stab him.</p>
<p>At that very instant, in came his mother, and,
catching hold of the vizier&rsquo;s arm, Sir, cried she, what
are you a-doing? Let me alone, replied the vizier,
that I may kill this base unworthy son. You shall
kill me first, cried the mother; nor will I suffer you
to imbrue your hands in your own blood: speak to
him, Noureddin, speak to him, and improve this tender
moment. My father, cried he, with tears in his
eyes, I implore your clemency and compassion; nor
must you deny me pardon, since I ask it in His
name before whom we must all appear at the last
day.</p>
<p>Khacan suffered the poniard to be taken out of his
hand; and as soon as Noureddin was released, he
threw himself at his father&rsquo;s feet, and kissed them,
to show how sincerely he repented of his having ever
offended him. Noureddin, said he, return your mother
thanks, since it is purely for her sake I pardon
you. I design also to give you the Fair Persian, on
condition that you will oblige yourself by an oath not
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
to look upon her any longer as a slave, but as your
wife, that you will not sell her, nor ever be divorced
from her; for, having abundance of wit and prudence,
besides much better conduct than you, I am
persuaded she will be able to moderate those rash
sallies of youth which are enough to ruin you.</p>
<p>Noureddin, who little expected to be treated after
so kind and indulgent a manner, returned his father
a thousand thanks, with all the gratitude and sincerity
imaginable; and, in the conclusion, the vizier,
the Fair Persian, and he, were well pleased and satisfied
with the match.</p>
<p>The vizier Khacan would not stay in expectation
of the king&rsquo;s asking him about the order he had
given him, but took particular care to mention it
often, in representing to his majesty the many difficulties
he met with in that affair, and how fearful he
was of not acquitting himself to his majesty&rsquo;s satisfaction.
In short, he managed the business with so
much cunning and address, that the king insensibly
forgot it; and, though Saouy had got some small information
of the matter, yet Khacan was so much
in the king&rsquo;s favour, that he was afraid to speak of
it.</p>
<p>It was now above a year that this nice affair had
been kept with greater secrecy than at first the vizier
expected; when, being one day in the bath, and
some important business obliging him to leave it all
in a sweat, the air, which was then a little moist,
struck a damp to his breast, caused a defluxion of
rheum to fall upon his lungs, which threw him into a
violent fever, and confined him to his bed. His illness
growing every day worse, and perceiving he
had but a few moments to live, he thus addressed
himself to his son Noureddin, who never stirred from
him during his whole sickness: My son, I know not
whether I have made a good use of the riches Heaven
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
has blessed me with, but you see they are not
able to save me from the hands of death: the last
thing I desire of you, with my dying breath, is, that
you would be mindful of the promise you made concerning
the Fair Persian; and, with a certainty of
that, I shall die pleased and well contented.</p>
<p>These were the vizier&rsquo;s last words; who, dying a
few moments after, left his family, the court, and
the whole city in great affliction for his death. The
king lamented him, as having lost a wise, zealous,
and faithful minister; and the whole city wept for
him as their protector and benefactor. Never was
there a funeral at Balsora solemnized with greater
pomp and magnificence; the viziers and emirs, and,
in general, all the grandees of the court, strove for
the honour of bearing his coffin, one after another,
upon their shoulders to the place of burial; and
both rich and poor accompanied him thither with
tears.</p>
<p>Noureddin gave all the demonstration of a sorrow
equal to the loss he had lately sustained, and lived
a great while without ever seeing any company. At
last, he admitted of a visit from an intimate friend of
his. His friend endeavoured to comfort him all he
could; and, finding him a little inclinable to hear
reason, he told him, that, having paid what was due
to the memory of his father, and fully satisfied all
that custom and decency required of him, it was now
high time to appear again in the world to converse
with his friends, and maintain a character suitable
to his birth and merit: For, continued he, we should
sin both against the laws of nature and civility, and
be thought insensible, if, upon the death of our fathers,
we neglected to pay them what filial love and
tenderness require at our hands; but having once
performed that duty, and put it out of the power of
any man to reproach us upon that account, we are
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
obliged to return to our usual method of living. Dry
up your tears then, and re-assume that wonted air of
gaiety which always inspires with joy those that have
the honour of your conversation.</p>
<p>This advice seeming very reasonable to Noureddin,
he was easily persuaded to follow it; and, if he
had been ruled by his friend in every thing, he would
certainly have avoided all the misfortunes that afterwards
befell him. He treated him very nobly; and,
when he took his leave, Noureddin desired him to
come the next day, and bring three or four friends
of their acquaintance. By this means he insensibly
fell into the society of about ten young gentlemen,
pretty near his own age, with whom he spent his
time in continual feasting and entertainments; and
scarce a day came over his head but he made every
one of them some considerable present.</p>
<p>Sometimes, to oblige his friends after a more particular
manner, Noureddin would send for the Fair
Persian to entertain them; who, notwithstanding her
obedience to his command, never approved of his
extravagant way of living, and often took the liberty
of speaking her mind freely. Sir, said she, I question
not but your father has left you abundance of
riches; but, how great soever they are, be not angry
with your slave for telling you that, at this rate of
living, you will quickly see an end of them. We
may indeed sometimes afford to treat our friends, and
be merry with them; but, to make a daily practice of
it, is certainly the high road to ruin and destruction.
Therefore, for your own honour and reputation, you
would do much better to follow the footsteps of your
deceased father, that, in time, you may rise to that
dignity by which he acquired so much glory and
renown.</p>
<p>Noureddin hearkened to the fair Persian&rsquo;s discourse
with a smiling countenance; and, when she had
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
done, My charmer, said he, with the same air of
mirth, say no more of that; let us talk of nothing but
mirth and pleasure. In my father&rsquo;s lifetime I was always
under restraint, and I am now resolved to enjoy
the liberty I so much sighed for before his death. It
is time enough for me to think of leading a sober regular
life; and a man of my age ought to taste the
pleasures of youth.</p>
<p>What contributed very much towards ruining Noureddin&rsquo;s
fortune, was his unwillingness to reckon with
his steward; for, whenever he brought in his accounts,
he still sent him away without examining
them. Go, go, said he, I trust wholly to your honesty;
therefore only take care to let me have wherewith
to make merry.</p>
<p>You are the master, sir, replied he, and I but the
steward; however, you would do well to think upon
the proverb, He that spends much and has but little,
must at last insensibly be reduced to poverty. You
are not contented with keeping an extravagant table,
but you must lavish away your estate with both
hands: and were your coffers as large as mountains,
they would not be sufficient to maintain you. Begone,
replied Noureddin; your grave lessons are needless;
only take care to provide good eating and drinking,
and trouble your head no farther about the rest.</p>
<p>In the mean time Noureddin&rsquo;s friends were constant
guests at his table, and never failed making
some advantage of the easiness of his temper. They
praised and flattered him, extolling his most indifferent
actions to the very skies. But, above all, they
took particular care to commend whatever belonged
to him and his; and this, they found, turned to some
account. Sir, says one of them, I came the other day
by your estate that lies in such a place: certainly
there is nothing so magnificent, or so handsomely
furnished, as your house; and the garden belonging
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
to it is a paradise upon earth. I am very glad it
pleases you, says Noureddin. Here, bring me pen,
ink, and paper: but, without more words, it is at
your service, and I make you a present of it. No
sooner had others commended his house, baths, and
some public buildings erected for the use of strangers,
the yearly revenue of which was very considerable,
than he immediately gave them away. The Fair Persian
could not forbear letting him know how much
injury he did himself; but, instead of taking any
notice of it, he continued his extravagances, and, upon
the first opportunity, squandered away the little he
had left.</p>
<p>In short, Noureddin did nothing for a whole year
together, but feasted and made himself merry, wasting
and consuming, after a prodigal manner, the
riches that his predecessors, and the good vizier his
father, had, with so much pains and care, heaped together
and preserved.</p>
<p>The year was but just expired, when somebody
one day knocked at the hall door, where he and his
friends were at dinner together by themselves, having
sent away their slaves, that they might enjoy a greater
liberty and freedom of conversation.</p>
<p>One of his friends offered to rise, but Noureddin
stepped before him, and opened the door himself. It
seems it was the steward; and Noureddin going a
little out of the hall to know his business, left the
door half open.</p>
<p>The friend that offered to rise from his seat, seeing
it was the steward, and being somewhat curious to
know what he had to say to Noureddin, placed himself
between the hangings and the door, where he
plainly overheard the steward&rsquo;s discourse to his master.
Sir, said the steward, I ask a thousand pardons
for my coming to disturb you in the height of your joys;
but this affair is of such importance, that I thought
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
myself bound in duty to acquaint you with it. I come,
sir, to make up my last accounts, and to tell you that
what I all along foresaw, and have often warned you of,
is at last come to pass. Behold, sir, says he, (showing
him a small piece of money,) the remainder of all the
sums I have received from you during my stewardship;
the other funds you were pleased to assign me
are all exhausted. The farmers, and those that owe
you rent, have made it so plainly appear to me that
you have assigned over to others whatever remains
in their hands due to you, that it is impossible for me
to get any more from them upon your account. Here
are my books; if you please, examine them: and if
you think fit to continue me in the place I am now in,
order me some other funds, or else give me leave to
quit your service. Noureddin was so astonished at this
discourse, that he gave him no manner of answer.</p>
<p>The friend who had been listening all this while,
and had heard every syllable of what the steward
said, immediately came in and told the company what
he had lately overheard. It is your business, gentlemen,
says he, to make use of this caution; for my
part, I declare it openly to you, this is the last visit I
design to make Noureddin. Nay, replied they, if
matters go thus, we have as little business here as
you; and, for the future, shall take care not to trouble
him with our company.</p>
<p>Noureddin returned presently after; yet, notwithstanding
his carrying it pleasantly to his guests, by
putting them into a merry humour again, he could not
so handsomely dissemble the matter but they plainly
perceived the truth of what they had been informed
of. He was scarce sat down in his place, when one
of his friends rose up, saying, Sir, I am sorry I cannot
have the honour of your company any longer; and,
therefore, I hope you will excuse my rudeness of
leaving you so soon. What urgent affair have you,
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
replied Noureddin, that obliges you to be going? My
wife, sir, said he, was brought to bed to-day, and upon
such an occasion, you know a husband&rsquo;s company is
very acceptable; so, making a very low bow, away
he went. A minute afterwards, a second took his
leave upon another sham excuse; and so one after
another, till at last not one of those ten friends that
had hitherto kept Noureddin company, was left in
the room.</p>
<p>As soon as they were gone, Noureddin, little suspecting
the resolution they had made of never visiting
him, went directly to the Fair Persian&rsquo;s apartment,
to whom, in private, he related all the steward had
told him, and seemed extremely concerned at the ill
posture of his affairs. Sir, said the Fair Persian to
him, you would never take my advice, but always
managed your concerns after your own way, and now
you see the fatal consequences of it. I find I was not
mistaken, when I presaged to what a miserable condition
you would bring yourself at last; but what afflicts
me the more, is, that at present you do not see
the worst of your misfortunes. Whenever I presumed
freely to impart my thoughts to you, Let us be merry,
said you, and in pleasures improve the time that fortune
has kindly given us; perhaps she will not always
be so prodigal of her favours. But was I now to blame
in telling you that we are the makers or undoers of
our own fortunes, by a prudent or foolish management
of them? You indeed would never hearken to
me; so, at last, much against my will, I was forced
to desist, and let you alone.</p>
<p>I must own, replied Noureddin, I was extremely
in the wrong in not following the advice that you,
out of your abundance of prudence and discretion,
was pleased to give me. It is true I have spent my
estate; but do you not consider it is among friends of
a long acquaintance, who, I am persuaded, have more
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
generosity and gratitude in them than to abandon and
forsake me in distress? Sir, replied the Fair Persian,
if you have nothing but the gratitude of your friends
to depend on, you are in a desperate condition; for,
believe me, that hope is vain and ill-grounded, and
you will tell me so yourself in a very little time.</p>
<p>To this Noureddin replied, Charming Persian, I
have a much better opinion of my friends&rsquo; generosity
than you. To-morrow I design to make a visit to
them all, before the usual time of their coming hither,
and you shall see me return with a vast sum, that
they will raise among them to support me. I am resolved
to change my way of living, and, with the money
they lend me, set up for a merchant.</p>
<p>The next morning, Noureddin failed not to visit his
ten friends, who lived in the very same street. He
knocked at the first door he came at, where one of
the richest of them lived. A slave came to the door;
but, before he would open it, he asked who was
there? Go to your master, says he to the slave, and
tell him it is Noureddin, the late vizier&rsquo;s son. Upon
this the slave opens the door, and shows him into a
hall, where he left him to go and tell his master, who
was in an inner room, that Noureddin was come to
wait on him. Noureddin! cried he, in a disdainful
tone, loud enough for Noureddin to hear it with surprise.
Go, tell him I am not at home; and whenever
he comes hither, be sure you give him the same answer.
The slave came back, and told Noureddin he
thought his master was within, but he was mistaken.</p>
<p>Noureddin came away in the greatest confusion in
the world. Ah! base, ungrateful wretch! said he to
himself, to treat me so basely to-day, after the vows
and protestations of love and friendship that you
made me yesterday! From thence he went to another
door, but that friend ordered his slaves also to say
he was gone out. He had the same answer at the
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
third; and, in short, all the rest denied themselves,
though every one of them was at home at the
same time.</p>
<p>It was now that Noureddin began in earnest to reflect
with himself, and be convinced of the folly of his
too credulous temper, in relying so much upon the
vows and protestations of amity, that his false friends
in the time of his prosperity had solemnly made him.
It is very true, said he to himself, that a fortunate
man, as I was, may be compared to a tree laden with
fruit, which, as long as there is any remaining on its
boughs, people will be crowding round; but, as soon
as it is stripped of all, they immediately leave it, and
go to another. He smothered his passions as much
as possible while he was abroad; but, no sooner was
he got home, than he gave loose to his sorrow, and resigned
himself wholly to it.</p>
<p>The Fair Persian, seeing him so extremely concerned,
fancied he had not found his friends so ready to
assist him as he expected. Well, sir, said she, are you
now convinced of the truth of what I told you? Ah!
cried he, my dear, thou hast been too true a prophetess;
for not one of them would so much as know
me, see me, or speak to me. Oh! who could ever
have believed that persons so highly obliged to me as
they are, and on whom I have spent my estate, could
ever have used me so barbarously? I am distracted,
and I fear committing some dishonourable action, below
myself, in the deplorable condition I am reduced
to, without the aid and assistance of your prudent advice.
Sir, replied the Fair Persian, I see no other
way of supporting yourself in your misfortunes, but
selling off your slaves and moveables, and living upon
the money, till Heaven shall find out some other
means to deliver you from your present misery.</p>
<p>Noureddin was very loath to make use of this expedient;
but what could he do in the necessitous circumstance
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
he was in? He first sold off his slaves;
those unprofitable mouths, which were a greater expense
to him than what his present condition could
bear. He lived on the money for some time; and
when all of it was spent, he ordered his goods to be
carried into the market-place, where they were sold
for half their worth; among which were several valuable
things that cost immense sums. Upon this he
lived for a considerable time: but that supply failing
at last, he had nothing at all left by which he could
raise any more money; of which he complained to
the Fair Persian in the most tender expressions that
sorrow could inspire.</p>
<p>Noureddin only waited to hear what answer this
prudent creature would make. Sir, said she, at last,
I am your slave, and you know that the late vizier
your father gave ten thousand pieces of gold for me:
perhaps I am a little sunk in value since that time, but
I believe I shall sell for pretty near that sum yet. Let
me entreat you then instantly to carry me to the market,
and expose me to sale; and with the money that
you get for me, which will be very considerable, you
may turn merchant in some city where you are unknown,
and by that means find a way of living, if not
in splendour, yet with happiness and content.</p>
<h3 title="">THE STORY OF NOUREDDIN AND THE FAIR PERSIAN CONTINUED.</h3>
<p>Ah! lovely and adorable Persian, cried Noureddin,
is it possible you can entertain such a thought
of me? Have I given you such slender proofs of my
love, that you should think me capable of so base an
action? But suppose me so vile a wretch, could I do
it without being guilty of perjury, after the oath I
have taken never to sell you? No, I could sooner die
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
than part with you, whom I love infinitely beyond
myself; though by the unreasonable proposition you
have made me, it is plain your love is not so tender
as mine.</p>
<p>Sir, replied the Fair Persian, I am sufficiently convinced
that your passion for me is as violent as you
say it is; and Heaven, who knows with what reluctance
I have made this proposition that you dislike,
is my witness, that mine is as great as yours; but, to
silence reason at once, I need only bid you remember
that necessity has no law. I love you to that degree,
it is impossible for you to love me more: and be assured,
that to what master soever I shall belong, my
passion shall always continue the same: and if you
are ever able to redeem me, as I hope you may, it
will be the greatest pleasure in the world to be in
your possession again. Alas! to what a fatal and
cruel necessity are we driven! But I see no other
way of freeing ourselves from the misery that involves
us both.</p>
<p>Noureddin, who very well knew the truth of what
the Fair Persian had spoken, and that there was no
other way of avoiding a shameful poverty, was in the
end forced to yield to her first request. Accordingly
he led her to the market, where the women-slaves are
exposed to sale, with a regret that cannot be easily
expressed. He applied himself to a courtier named
Hagi Hassan: Hagi Hassan, said he, here is a slave
that I have a mind to sell; I pray thee to see what
they will give for her. Hagi Hassan desired Noureddin
and the Fair Persian to walk into a room; and
when she had pulled off the veil that covered her
face, Sir, said Hagi Hassan to Noureddin, in a great
surprise, if I am not mistaken, this is the slave your
father, the late vizier, gave ten thousand pieces of
gold for? Noureddin assured him it was the same;
and Hagi Hassan gave him some hopes of selling her
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
at a good rate, and promised to use all his art and
cunning to raise her price as high as it would bear.</p>
<p>Hagi Hassan and Noureddin went out of the room,
and locked the Fair Persian in; after which Hagi
Hassan went to look after the merchants; but they
being busy in buying slaves that came from different
countries, he was forced to stay till the market was
done. When their sale was over, and the greatest
part of them got together, My masters, said he to
them, with an air of gaiety in his looks and actions,
every thing that is round is not a nut; every thing
that is long is not a fig; all that is red is not flesh;
and all eggs are not fresh. It is true you have seen
and bought a great many slaves in your lives, but you
never yet saw one comparable to her I am going to
tell you of; in short, she is the very pearl of slaves.
Come, follow me, and you shall see her yourselves,
and by that judge at what rate I shall cry her.</p>
<p>The merchants followed Hagi Hassan into the
chamber where the Fair Persian was; and, as soon as
they beheld her, they were so surprised at her beauty,
that at the first word they unanimously agreed that
four thousand pieces of gold was the very lowest price
that they could set upon her. The merchants then
left the room, and Hagi Hassan, who came out with
them, without going any farther, proclaimed with a
loud voice, Four thousand pieces of gold for the Persian
slave.</p>
<p>None of the merchants had yet offered any thing,
and they were but just consulting together about
what they might afford to give for her, when the vizier
Saouy, perceiving Noureddin in the market, appeared.
Said he to himself, Noureddin has certainly
made some more money of his goods, (for he knew of
his exposing them to sale,) and is come hither to buy
a slave with it. Upon this he advanced forward just as
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
Hagi Hassan began to proclaim a second time, Four
thousand pieces of gold for the Persian slave.</p>
<p>The vizier Saouy, concluding by the extravagance
of the price, that she must be some extraordinary
piece of beauty, had a longing desire to see her; so
spurring his horse forward, he rode directly up to
Hagi Hassan, who was in the very middle of the merchants.
Open the door, said he, and let me see this
slave. It was never the custom to show their slaves
to any particular person, till after the merchants had
seen her, and had the refusal: but Saouy being a
person of so great authority, none of them durst dispute
their right with him; and Hagi Hassan being
forced to open the door, beckoned the fair slave to
come forward, that Saouy might have a sight of her
without the trouble of alighting from his horse.</p>
<p>The vizier was astonished at the sight of so beautiful
a slave; and knowing the courtier&rsquo;s name, (having
formerly dealt with him,) Hagi Hassan, said he,
is it not at four thousand pieces of gold that you cry
her? Yes, sir, answered he, it is but a moment since
I cried her at that price, and the merchants you see
gathered together here are come to bid money for her;
and I question not but they will give a great deal
more than that.</p>
<p>If nobody offers any higher, I will give that sum,
replied Saouy, looking upon the merchants at the
same time with a countenance that forbade them to
advance any more. In short, he was so universally
dreaded, that nobody durst speak a word, not so
much as to complain of his encroaching upon their
privilege.</p>
<p>The vizier Saouy having staid some time, and finding
none of the merchants outbid him, What do you
stay for? said he to Hagi Hassan: go, look after the
seller, and strike a bargain with him at four thousand
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
pieces of gold, or more if he demands it; not knowing
yet the slave belonged to Noureddin.</p>
<p>Hagi Hassan having locked the chamber-door,
went to confer notes with Noureddin: Sir, said he to
him, I am very sorry to bring you the ill news of your
slave&rsquo;s being just going to be sold for nothing. How
so? replied Noureddin. Why sir, said Hagi Hassan,
you must know that the business at first went on
rarely; for, as soon as the merchants had seen your
slave, they ordered me to cry her at four thousand
pieces of gold. Accordingly I cried her at the price;
upon which the vizier Saouy came, and his presence
has stopped the mouths of all the merchants, who
seemed inclinable to raise her, at least to the same
price your deceased father gave for her. Saouy will
give no more than four thousand pieces, and it is
much against my inclination that I am come to tell
you the despicable price he offers. The slave indeed
is your own; but I will not advise you to part with
her upon those terms, since you and every body else
are sensible of her being worth infinitely more: besides,
he is base enough to contrive a way to trick
you out of the money.</p>
<p>Hagi Hassan, replied Noureddin, I am highly
obliged to thee for thy advice; but do not think I
will ever sell my slave to an enemy of our family.
My necessities indeed are at present very great, but I
would sooner die in the most shameful poverty, than
ever consent to the delivering her up to his arms. I
have only one thing to beg of thee, who art skilful in
all the turns and shifts of life, that thou wouldst put
me in a way to prevent the sale of her.</p>
<p>Sir, said Hagi Hassan, there is nothing more easy:
you must pretend, that, being in a violent passion
with your slave, you swore to expose her in the market,
and for the sake of your oath you have now
brought her hither, without any manner of intention
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
of selling her. This will satisfy every body, and
Saouy will have nothing to say against it. Come
along with me then; and just as I am presenting her
to Saouy, as if it were by your own consent, pull her
to you, give her two or three blows, and send her
home. I thank thee for thy counsel, said Noureddin,
and thou shalt see I will make use of it.</p>
<p>Hagi Hassan went back to the chamber, and having
in two words acquainted the Fair Persian with
their design, that she might not be surprised at it, he
took her by the hand, and led her to the vizier Saouy,
who was still, on horseback at the door: Sir, said he,
here is the slave: she is yours; pray take her.</p>
<p>These words were scarce out of Hagi Hassan&rsquo;s
mouth, when Noureddin, catching hold of the Fair
Persian, pulled her to him, and giving her a box on
the ear, Come hither, impertinence, said he, and get
you home again; for though your ill humour obliged
me to swear I would bring you hither, yet I never
intended to sell you; I have business for you to do
yet, and it will be time enough to part with you when
I have nothing else left.</p>
<p>This action of Noureddin&rsquo;s put the vizier Saouy
into a violent passion. Miserable debauchee, cried
he, wouldst thou have me believe thou hast any thing
else left to make money of but thy slave? And at the
same instant, spurring his horse directly against him,
endeavoured to have carried off the Fair Persian.
Noureddin, nettled to the quick at the affront the
vizier had put upon him, quits the Fair Persian, and,
laying hold of his horse&rsquo;s bridle, made him run two
or three paces backwards. Vile dotard, said he to
the vizier, I would tear thy soul out of thy body this
very moment, were it not for the crowd of people
here present.</p>
<p>The vizier Saouy being loved by nobody, but, on
the contrary, hated by all, there was not one among
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
them but was now pleased to see Noureddin mortifying
him a little; and, by shrewd signs, they let him
understand he might revenge himself upon him as
much as he pleased, for nobody would meddle with
their quarrel.</p>
<p>Saouy endeavoured all he could to make Noureddin
quit the bridle; but he being a lusty vigorous man,
and encouraged by those that stood by, pulled him off
his horse, in the middle of a brook, gave him a thousand
blows, and dashed his head against the stones
till it was all of a gore of blood. The slaves that
waited upon the vizier would fain have drawn their
scimitars and fallen upon Noureddin, but the merchants
interposing prevented them from doing it.
What do you mean? said they to them; do not you
see the one is a vizier, and the other a vizier&rsquo;s son?
Let them dispute their quarrel themselves; perhaps
they will be reconciled one time or other; whereas, if
you had killed Noureddin, your master, with all his
greatness, could not have been able to protect you
against the law.</p>
<p>Noureddin having given over beating the vizier
Saouy, left him in the middle of the brook, and taking
the Fair Persian, marched home with her, being attended
by the people with shouts and acclamations
for the action he had performed.</p>
<p>The vizier Saouy, cruelly bruised with the strokes
he had received, by the assistance of his slaves made
shift to get up, and had the mortification to see himself
besmeared all over with blood and dirt. He
leaned upon the shoulders of two slaves, and in that
condition went straight to the palace, in the sight of
all the people, with so much greater confusion because
nobody pitied him. As soon as he reached the
king&rsquo;s apartment, he began to cry out, and call for
justice, after a lamentable manner. The king ordered
him to be admitted; and as soon as he came, he asked
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
him who it was that had abused and put him into
that miserable pickle. Sir, cried Saouy, your majesty
ought to afford me a large share of your favour, and
to take into your royal consideration my late abuse,
since it was chiefly upon your account that I have
been so barbarously treated. Say no more of that,
replied the king, but let me hear the whole story,
simply as it is, and who the offender is; and if he is
in the wrong, you may depend upon it he shall be
severely punished.</p>
<p>Sir, said Saouy then, telling the whole matter to
his own advantage, having an occasion for a cook-maid,
I went to the market of women-slaves to buy
me one. When I came thither, there was a slave
just cried at four thousand pieces of gold: I ordered
them to bring the slave before me, and I think my
eyes never did, nor ever will, behold a more glorious
creature than she is. I had not time to examine
her beauty thoroughly: but, however, I immediately
asked to whom she belonged; and upon inquiry I
found that Noureddin, son to the late vizier Khacan,
had the disposing of her.</p>
<p>Sir, you may remember that, about two or three
years ago, you gave that vizier ten thousand pieces of
gold, strictly charging him to buy you a slave with it.
The money indeed was laid out upon this very slave;
but instead of bringing her to your majesty, thinking
his son deserved her better, he made him a present of
her. Noureddin, since his father&rsquo;s death, having wasted
his whole fortune in riot and feasting, has nothing
left but this slave, which he intended to part with,
and therefore she was to be sold in his name. I sent
for him, and without mentioning any thing of his father&rsquo;s
baseness, or rather treachery, to your majesty,
I very civilly said to him, Noureddin, the merchants,
I perceive, have put your slave up at four thousand
pieces of gold; and I question not but, in emulation
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
of each other, they will raise the price considerably:
let me have her for the four thousand pieces; I am
going to buy her for the king, our lord and master:
this will be a handsome opportunity of making your
court to him, and his favour will be worth a great deal
more than the merchants can propose to give you.</p>
<p>Instead of returning me a civil answer, as in good
manners he ought to have done, the insolent wretch
beholding me with an air of fierceness, Decrepit villain,
said he, I would rather sell my slave to a Jew for
nothing than to thee for money. Noureddin, replied
I, without any manner of passion, though I had some
reason to be a little warm, you do not consider that
in talking at this rate you affront the king, who has
raised your father and me to the honours we have
enjoyed.</p>
<p>This admonition, instead of moving him to a compliance,
provoked him to a higher degree; so that,
falling upon me like a madman, he pulled me off my
horse, beat me as long as he could stand over me, and
has put me into this miserable plight your majesty
sees me in; and therefore I beseech you, sir, to consider
me, since it is upon your account I have been so
openly affronted. At the end of these words, he
bowed his head, and turning about, wept a plentiful
shower of tears.</p>
<p>The abused king, highly incensed against Noureddin
by this relation, full of malice and artifice, discovered
by his countenance the violence of his anger;
and, turning to the captain of his guards that stood
near him, Take forty of your soldiers, said he, and
immediately go plunder Noureddin&rsquo;s house; and,
having ordered it to be razed to the ground, bring
him and his slave along with you.</p>
<p>The captain of the guards was not gone out of the
king&rsquo;s presence, when a gentleman-usher belonging to
the court, who overheard the order that had been
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
given, got before him. His name was Sangiar, and
he had been formerly the vizier Khacan&rsquo;s slave, by
whose favour he was brought into the court service,
where by degrees he was advanced higher.</p>
<p>Sangiar, full of gratitude to his old master, and
affection for Noureddin, with whom in his infancy he
had often played, and being no stranger to Saouy&rsquo;s
hatred to Khacan&rsquo;s family, could not hear the orders
without concern and trembling. May be, said he to
himself, this action of Noureddin&rsquo;s is not altogether
so black as Saouy has represented it; but, however,
the king is prejudiced against him, and will certainly
put him to death without allowing him time to justify
himself.</p>
<p>Sangiar made so much haste to Noureddin&rsquo;s house,
as to get thither time enough to acquaint him with
what had passed at court, and to desire him to provide
for his own and the Fair Persian&rsquo;s safety. He knocked
so violently loud at the door, that Noureddin, who had
been a great while without any servant, ran immediately
to open it: My dear lord, said Sangiar, here is
no more staying for you in Balsora: if you design to
save yourself, you must lose no time, but depart hence
this very moment.</p>
<p>Why so? replied Noureddin; what is the reason I
must be gone so soon? Ah! sir, said Sangiar, make
haste away, and take your slave with you; for, in
short, Saouy has been just now acquainting the king,
after his own way of telling it, all that happened between
you and him; and the captain of the guards
will be here in an instant, with forty soldiers, and
seize you and the Fair Persian. Here, sir, take these
forty pieces of gold; it is all I have about me, to assist
you in finding out some other place of safety.
Excuse my not staying any longer with you: I leave
you with a great deal of unwillingness; but I do it
for the good of us both. I have so much interest with
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
the captain of the guards, that he will take no notice
of me. Sangiar gave Noureddin but just time to
thank him, and away he went.</p>
<p>Noureddin presently acquainted the Fair Persian
with the absolute necessity of their going that moment.
She only staid to put on her veil, and then they both
stole out of the house together, and were so very lucky,
as not only to get clear of the city, without the least
notice being taken of their escape, but also safely to
arrive at the mouth of the Euphrates, where they embarked
in a vessel that lay ready to weigh anchor.</p>
<p>They were no sooner on ship-board than the captain
came upon deck amongst his passengers: My children,
said he to them, are you all here? have any of you
any more business to do in the city? or have you left
any thing behind you? They answered him they were
all there, and ready prepared; so that he might set
sail as soon as he pleased. When Noureddin came
aboard, the first question he asked was, whither the
ship was bound? and being told for Bagdad, he greatly
rejoiced at it. And now the captain having weighed
anchor, set sail, and the vessel with a very favourable
wind lost sight of Balsora.</p>
<p>But now let us see how matters went at Balsora,
in the mean time, while Noureddin and the Fair Persian
made their escape from the fury of the enraged
king.</p>
<p>The captain of the guards came to Noureddin&rsquo;s
house and knocked at the door, but nobody coming
to open it, he ordered his soldiers to break it down,
who immediately obeyed him, and in they rushed in
a full body. They searched every hole and corner of
the house, but neither he nor the Fair Persian were to
be found. The captain of the guards made them inquire
of the neighbours, and he asked himself if they
had seen them lately: it was all in vain; for, though
they had seen him go out of his house, so universally
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
beloved was Noureddin, that not one of them would
have said the least word that might be injurious to
him. As soon as they had rifled the house and levelled
it to the ground, they went to acquaint the king
with the news. Look for them, said he, in some other
places, for I am resolved to have them found.</p>
<p>The captain of the guards made a second search
after them; and the king dismissed the vizier Saouy
with a great deal of honour. Go home, said he to him;
trouble yourself no farther with Noureddin&rsquo;s punishment;
for with my own hand I will revenge the insolence
he has offered your person.</p>
<p>Without any farther delay, the king ordered the
public criers to proclaim throughout the whole city a
reward of a thousand pieces of gold for any person
that should apprehend Noureddin and the Fair Persian,
with a severe punishment upon whomsoever
should conceal them. But after all this pains and
trouble, there was no news to be heard of them; and
the vizier Saouy had only the comfort of seeing the
king espouse his quarrel.</p>
<p>In the mean time, Noureddin and the Fair Persian,
after a prosperous voyage, landed safe at Bagdad. As
soon as the captain came within sight of that city,
pleased that his voyage was at an end, Children, cried
he to the passengers, cheer up, and be merry! look,
yonder is that great and wonderful city, where there
is perpetual concourse of people from all parts of the
world: there you shall meet with innumerable crowds
every day, and never feel the extremity of cold in
winter, nor the excess of heat in summer; but enjoy
an eternal spring, always crowned with flowers, and
the delicious fruits of autumn.</p>
<p>When the vessel came to anchor a little below the
city, the passengers got ashore, and every body went
to the place they designed to lie at that night. Noureddin
gave the captain five pieces of gold for his passage,
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
and went ashore also with the Fair Persian;
but being a perfect stranger in Bagdad, he was at a
loss for a lodging. They rambled a considerable time
about the gardens that bordered on the Tigris; and,
keeping close to one of them that was enclosed with a
very high wall, at the end of it they turned into a
street finely paved, where they perceived a garden
door, and a charming fountain near it.</p>
<p>The door, which was very magnificent, happened to
be shut, but the porch was open, in which there stood
a sofa on each side. This is a very convenient place
for us, said Noureddin to the Fair Persian: night comes
on apace; and though we have eaten nothing since
our landing, yet I believe we must even lie here to-night,
and to-morrow we shall have time enough to
get a lodging; what say ye to it, my dear? Sir, replied
the Fair Persian, you know very well I am never
against what you propose; therefore let us go no farther,
since you are willing to stay here. Each of them
having drunk a draught of water at the fountain, they
laid themselves down upon one of the sofas; and, after
a little chat, being invited by the agreeable murmur
of the water, they fell fast asleep.</p>
<p>The garden, it seems, belonged to the caliph; and
in the middle of it there was a pavilion, called the Pavilion
of Pictures, because its chief ornament was
pictures, after the Persian manner, drawn by the most
celebrated limners in Persia, whom the caliph sent for
on purpose. The stately hall beneath this pavilion
was adorned with fourscore windows, and in every
window a branched candlestick. The candles were
never lighted but when the caliph came thither to
spend the evening, which was never but when the
weather was so very calm that not a breath of air was
stirring. Then, indeed, they made a glorious illumination,
and could be plainly discerned at a vast distance
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
in the country on that side, and by the greatest
part of the city.</p>
<p>There was but one person that had the charge of
this fine garden, and the place was at this time enjoyed
by a very ancient officer, named Scheich Ibrahim,
whom the caliph himself, for some important
service, put into that employment, with a strict charge
not to let all sorts of people in, but especially to suffer
nobody either to sit or lie down on the sofas that
stood at the outward door, that they might always be
clean and handsome; and whenever he found any
body there, to punish them severely.</p>
<p>Some business had obliged this officer to go abroad,
and he was not as yet returned. When he came back,
there was just daylight enough for him to discern two
persons asleep upon one of the sofas, with both their
heads under a piece of linen cloth, to secure them from
the gnats. Very well, said Scheich Ibrahim to himself,
here are brave people, to disobey the caliph&rsquo;s
orders; but I shall take care to pay them handsomely
what they deserve. Upon this, he opens the door
very softly, and a moment after returns with a swinging
cane in his hand, and his sleeve tucked up to the
elbow. He was just going to lay on them with all his
force; but, withholding his arm, he began to reason
with himself after this manner: Thou wast going to
strike, without any consideration that these perhaps
are strangers, destitute of a lodging, and utterly ignorant
of the caliph&rsquo;s order; for that reason, it would
be advisable in thee to know first who they are. Upon
this, he gently lifts up the linen that covered their
heads, and being wonderfully astonished to see two
persons so mightily beautiful and well-shaped, waked
Noureddin, with pulling him softly by the feet.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smaller">Drawn by R. Westall R.A. Engraved by Chad Heath.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Noureddin presently lifting up his head, and seeing
an old man with a long white beard standing at his
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
feet, got up, and throwing himself upon his knees,
Good father, said he, Heaven preserve you! What do
you want, my son? replied Scheich Ibrahim: who are
you, and from whence came you? We are strangers
newly arrived, answered Noureddin, and we would
fain tarry here till to-morrow. This is not a proper
place for you, said Scheich Ibrahim: but come in with
me, and I will find one fitter for you to sleep in than
this; and I fancy the sight of the garden, which is
very fine, will please you, when you see it to-morrow
by daylight. Is this garden your own? said Noureddin.
Yes, replied Scheich Ibrahim; it is an inheritance
left me by my father: pray walk in, for I
am sure you will not repent your seeing it.</p>
<p>Noureddin rose up to thank Scheich Ibrahim for
the civility he had shown them, and afterwards the
Fair Persian and he went into the garden. Scheich
Ibrahim locked the door, and going before, led them
to an eminence, from whence at one look they might
almost take a view of the grandeur, order, and beauty
of the whole garden.</p>
<p>Noureddin had seen very fine gardens in Balsora,
but never any comparable to this. Having satisfied
his curiosity in looking upon every thing worth taking
notice of, as he was walking in one of the alleys, he
turned about to the officer that was with him, and
asked what his name was. As soon as he told him
it was Scheich Ibrahim; Scheich Ibrahim, said he to
him, I must confess this is a charming garden indeed.
Heaven send you long to enjoy the pleasures of it;
and we cannot sufficiently thank you for the favour of
showing us a place so worthy our seeing. However, it
is but just that we should make you some amends for
your kindness: therefore, here are two pieces of gold;
take them, and get us something to eat, that we may
be merry together before we part.</p>
<p>At the sight of the two pieces of gold, Scheich
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
Ibrahim, who was a great admirer of that metal,
laughed in his sleeve: he took them, and leaving
Noureddin and the Fair Persian by themselves, went
to provide what he was sent about. As soon as he
was alone, said he to himself with abundance of joy,
These are generous people; I should highly have injured
myself, if, through imprudence or rashness, I
had abused or driven them hence: the tenth part of
the money will treat them like princes, and the rest
I will keep for my pains and trouble.</p>
<p>While Scheich Ibrahim was gone to fetch something
for his own supper, as well as for his guests, Noureddin
and the Fair Persian took a walk in the garden,
sometimes in one place and sometimes in another,
till at last they came to the pavilion of pictures that
was in the middle of it. They stood a pretty while to
admire its wonderful structure, beauty, and loftiness;
and, after taking a full view of it on every side, they
went up a great many steps of fine white marble, to
the hall door, which they found locked.</p>
<p>They were but just got to the bottom of the steps
as Scheich Ibrahim returned, loaded with provisions.
Scheich Ibrahim, said Noureddin in a great surprise,
did you not tell us that this was your garden? I did,
replied Scheich Ibrahim, and do so still. And does
this magnificent pavilion also belong to you? said
Noureddin. Scheich Ibrahim was put to a nonplus,
and would not hearken to any more questions: For,
said he to himself, if I should say it is none of mine,
he will presently ask me how I can be the master of
the garden and not the pavilion? So, being willing
to make them believe the garden was his, he said the
same of the pavilion. My son, said he, the pavilion
is not distinct from the garden, but they both belong
to me. If so, said Noureddin, since you are willing to
let us be your guests to-night, do us the favour to show
us the inside of it; for, if we may judge by the outward
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
appearance, it must certainly be very splendid and
magnificent.</p>
<p>It would have been a great piece of incivility in
Scheich Ibrahim to have refused Noureddin that favour,
after the returns he had made him: moreover,
he considered that the caliph not having given any
notice, according to the usual custom, it was likely he
would not be there that night, and therefore resolved
to treat his guests, and sup with them in that room.
He laid the provisions upon the first step, while he
went to his chamber to fetch the key. He soon returned
with a light, and opened the door.</p>
<p>Noureddin and the Fair Persian entered the hall;
and finding it so extravagantly surprising, could not
forbear admiring the beauty and richness of the place.
Indeed, without saying anything of the pictures, which
were admirably well drawn, the sofas were very noble
and costly; and, besides the branched candlesticks
that were fixed to every window, there was a silver
spring between each cross bar, with a wax candle in
it. Noureddin could not behold those glorious objects,
which put him in mind of his former greatness,
without sighing.</p>
<p>In the mean time, Scheich Ibrahim was getting supper
ready; and the cloth being laid upon a sofa, and
every thing in order, Noureddin and the Fair Persian
and he sat down and ate together. When supper was
done, and they had washed their hands, Noureddin
opened the casement, and calling the Fair Persian to
him, Come hither, my dear, said he, and with me admire
the charming prospect and beauty of the garden
by moonlight; for certainly nothing can be more
agreeable. She came to him, and they both together
diverted themselves with that lovely object, while
Scheich Ibrahim was busy in taking away the cloth.</p>
<p>When Scheich Ibrahim came to his guests again,
Noureddin asked him whether he had any good liquor
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
in his lodgings to treat them with. What liquor would
you have? replied Scheich Ibrahim. Sherbet, I have
the best in the world; but sherbet, you know, my
son, is never drunk after supper.</p>
<p>I know that very well, said Noureddin; it is not
sherbet, but another sort of liquor that we ask you
for; and I am surprised at your not understanding
me. It is wine that I perceive you speak of, said
Scheich Ibrahim. You have hit right, replied Noureddin;
and if you have any, pray let us have a bottle:
you know a bottle after supper is a very proper
companion to spend the hours with till bed-time.</p>
<p>Heaven defend me from keeping wine in my house,
cried Scheich Ibrahim, and from ever coming to a
place where any is to be sold! A man as I am, who
has been a pilgrimage four times to Mecca, has renounced
wine for ever.</p>
<p>However, said Noureddin, you would do us a singular
kindness in getting us a little for our own drinking:
and if it be not too much trouble, I will put you
in a way how you may do it, without ever going into
the inn, or so much as laying your hand upon the vessel
that contains it. Upon that condition, I will do
it, replied Scheich Ibrahim; therefore pray let me
know how I am to manage it.</p>
<p>Why then, said Noureddin to him, we just now saw
an ass tied at the entrance of the garden, which certainly
must be yours, and which you may make use
of in this extremity. Here are two pieces of gold
more; take them, and lead your ass with the panniers
towards the next inn: you may stand at as great a
distance as you please; only give something to the
next passenger that comes by, and desire him to go
with your ass to the inn, there load him with two pitchers
of wine, one in one pannier and another in another,
which he must pay for out of the money we have given
you; and so let him bring the ass back to you: you will
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
have nothing to do but drive the beast hither before
you; for we will take the wine out of the panniers;
and by this means you will act nothing but what you
may do without any scruple at all.</p>
<p>The two last pieces of gold that Scheich Ibrahim
was going to receive, wrought wonderfully upon his
temper. Ah! my son, cried he, after Noureddin had
done speaking, you have contrived the matter rarely;
and had it not been for your invention, I should never
have found out a way of getting you some wine, without
a little scruple of conscience. Away he went to
execute the orders he had received; and upon his return,
which was in a little time, Noureddin went down
stairs, and taking the wine out of the panniers, carried
it into the hall.</p>
<p>Scheich Ibrahim having led the ass back to the
place from whence he took him, came back again.
Scheich Ibrahim, said Noureddin to him, we cannot
enough thank you for the trouble we have already
given you; but, my friend, we want something yet.
What is that? replied Scheich Ibrahim; is it anything
that I can be farther serviceable to you in?
Why, said Noureddin, we have no cups to drink out
of; and a little choice fruit, if you have any, would
be very acceptable to us. Do but say what you have
a mind to, replied Scheich Ibrahim, and you shall have
every thing to your heart&rsquo;s content.</p>
<p>Down went Scheich Ibrahim, and in a short time
spread a table for them with porcelain dishes, full of
all sorts of delicious fruits, besides a great number of
gold and silver cups to drink out of; and having asked
them if they wanted any thing else, he withdrew,
though they pressed him earnestly to stay.</p>
<p>Noureddin and the Fair Persian sat down again,
and after a cup a-piece, they were mightily pleased
with the wine. Well, my dear, said Noureddin to the
Fair Persian, are we not the most fortunate persons
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
in the world, after so many dangers, to meet with so
charming and agreeable a place? come, let us be
merry, and think no more on the hardships of our
voyage. Can my happiness be greater in this world,
than to have you on one side of me, and my bottle on
the other? They took off their cups pretty heartily,
and diverted themselves very agreeably, in singing
each of them a song.</p>
<p>Both of them having very fine voices, but especially
the Fair Persian, Scheich Ibrahim, who had stood
hearkening a great while on the steps without discovering
himself, was perfectly charmed with their songs.
He could contain himself no longer; but, thrusting
his head in at the door, Courage, sir, said he to Noureddin,
whom he took to be quite drunk; I am overjoyed
to see you so merry.</p>
<p>Ah! Scheich Ibrahim, cried Noureddin, turning to
him, you are a glorious man, and we are extremely
obliged to you. We dare not ask you to drink a cup;
but pray walk in, and let us have the honour at least
of your company. Excuse me, sir, said Scheich Ibrahim;
the pleasure of hearing your songs is sufficient
for me. Upon this, he immediately retired.</p>
<p>The Fair Persian perceiving Scheich Ibrahim,
through one of the windows, standing upon the steps
without the door, told Noureddin of it. Sir, said she,
you see what an aversion he has for wine; yet I question
not in the least to make him drink some, if you
would do as I would have you. Noureddin asked her
what it was. Do but say the word, replied he, and
I am ready to do what you please. Prevail with him,
then, only to come in and bear us company: some
time after, fill up a bumper, and give it him; if he
refuses it, drink it off, feign yourself to be asleep, and
leave the rest to me.</p>
<p>Noureddin quickly finding out the drift of the Fair
Persian&rsquo;s design, called to Scheich Ibrahim, who came
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
again to the door: Scheich Ibrahim, said he, we are
your guests; you have entertained us after the most
obliging manner in the world; and will you now refuse
us the honour of bearing us company? We do not
ask you to drink, but only the favour of seeing you.</p>
<p>Scheich Ibrahim being at last prevailed upon, came
into the hall, and sat down upon the edge of a sofa
that stood the nearest to the door. You do not sit well
there, said Noureddin; besides, you are too far off for
us to converse with you: pray come nearer, and sit
down by the lady, since she will have it so. I will
obey you, replied Scheich Ibrahim; so, coming forward
with a simpering countenance, to think he should
be seated near so beautiful a creature, he placed himself
at some distance from the Fair Persian. Noureddin
desired a song of her, upon the account of the
honour that Scheich Ibrahim had done them; and
she sang one that charmed him to an ecstasy.</p>
<p>When the Fair Persian had ended her song, Noureddin
poured out a cup of wine, and presented it to
Scheich Ibrahim; Scheich Ibrahim, said he, here,
drink this to our healths. Sir, replied he, starting
back, as if the very sight of the wine had put him into
a horror and confusion, I beseech you to excuse me;
I have already told you, that I have forsworn the use
of wine these many years. Then positively you will
not drink our healths, said Noureddin; however, give
me leave to drink yours.</p>
<p>While Noureddin was drinking, the Fair Persian
cut a piece of apple, and presented it to Scheich
Ibrahim. Though you refused drinking, said she, yet
I believe you will not refuse eating this piece of apple,
since it is a very good one. Scheich Ibrahim had no
power to refuse it from so fair a hand; but taking it
with a very low bow, kissed it, and put it in his mouth.
She said a great many amorous things upon that occasion;
and Noureddin tumbling back upon a sofa,
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
pretended to fall fast asleep. The Fair Persian presently
advanced towards Scheich Ibrahim; and speaking
in a very low voice, See, said she, the sleepy sot!
thus, in all our merry bouts, he constantly serves me;
and no sooner has he drunk a cup or two, than he falls
asleep, and leaves me alone; but I hope you will have
the goodness to keep me company till he awakes.</p>
<p>At this, the Fair Persian took a cup, and filling it
to the brim with wine, offered it to Scheich Ibrahim:
Here, said she, drink off this to my health: I am going
to pledge you. Scheich Ibrahim made a great
many difficulties of the matter at first, and begged her
to excuse him from drinking; but, at last, overcome
by her charms and entreaties, he took the cup, and
drank every drop of the wine off.</p>
<p>The good old man loved a cheruping cup to his
heart, but was ashamed to drink among strangers.
He often went to the tavern in private, as abundance
of people do; and now his hand being once in, without
any more ceremony, or round-about ways, as Noureddin
had instructed him, he goes directly to the next
inn, where he was very well known, and fetches some
more wine (the night serving him instead of a cloak)
with the money that Noureddin had ordered him to
give the messenger that went for the first.</p>
<p>As soon as Scheich Ibrahim had taken off his cup,
and made an end of the piece of apple, the Fair Persian
filled him out another, which he received with
less difficulty than the former, but made none at all
at the third. In short, he drank four times before
ever Noureddin discovered his pretended sleeping;
but then bursting out into a violent fit of laughter, he
rose up, and looking upon him, Ha! ha! said he,
Scheich Ibrahim, are you caught at last? did you not
tell me you had forsworn wine? and now you have
drank it all up from me.</p>
<p>Scheich Ibrahim, not expecting to be surprised after
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
that manner, blushed a little: however, that did not
spoil his draught: but when he had done, Sir, said he
to Noureddin, laughing, if there is any crime in what
I have done, it lies at this fair lady&rsquo;s door, not mine;
for who could possibly resist so many charms?</p>
<p>The Fair Persian, who knew well enough what
Noureddin would be at, took Scheich Ibrahim&rsquo;s part:
Let him talk, said she; Scheich Ibrahim, take no notice
of him; but let us drink on, and be merry. A
while after, Noureddin fills out a cup for himself and
the Fair Persian; but when Scheich Ibrahim saw that
Noureddin had forgot him in his turn, he took his cup,
and presenting it to the Fair Persian, Madam, said
he, do I pretend I cannot drink now?</p>
<p>At these words of Scheich Ibrahim&rsquo;s, Noureddin
and the Fair Persian were ready to split their sides
with laughing. Noureddin poured him out some wine;
and there they sat laughing, chatting, and drinking,
till pretty near midnight. About that hour, the Fair
Persian began to take notice of there being but one
candle upon the table. Scheich Ibrahim, said she to
the good old officer, methinks you might have afforded
us another candle, since there are so many wax-lights
yonder: pray do us the favour to light some of them,
that we may see a little better what we are doing
here.</p>
<p>Scheich Ibrahim making use of the liberty that
wine gives a man, when it gets up into the crown-office,
and not caring to be interrupted in his discourse
with Noureddin, bid the Fair Persian light them herself:
It is fitter for you to do it than me, said he: but,
hark ye, be sure not to light above five or six; for
this is enough. Up rose the Fair Persian immediately,
and taking a wax-candle in her hand, lights it with
that which stood upon the table; and, without any
regard to Scheich Ibrahim&rsquo;s orders, set fire to the
whole fourscore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>By and by, while Scheich Ibrahim was entertaining
the Fair Persian with some other discourse, Noureddin
took his turn to desire him to light up some of the
candles in the branched candlesticks, not taking notice
that all the wax-lights were already in a blaze:
Certainly, replied Scheich Ibrahim, you are lazier, or
less vigorous, than I am, that you are not able to light
them yourself: get you gone; but be sure you light
no more than three. To work he went; but, instead
of that number, he lighted them all, and opened the
shutters of the fourscore windows, before Scheich
Ibrahim, who was deeply engaged with the Fair Persian,
knew any thing of the matter.</p>
<p>The caliph Haroun Alraschid being not yet gone
to bed, was in a parlour at his palace by the river
Tigris, from whence he could take a side-view both
of the garden and pavilion. By chance, he opened
the casement, and seeing the pavilion was illuminated,
was mightily surprised at it; and at first, by the greatness
of the light, thought the city was on fire. The
grand vizier Giafar was still with him, who only waited
for his going to rest, and then designed to go home
too. The caliph, in a great rage, called the vizier to
him: Careless vizier, said he, come hither, look upon
the pavilion of pictures, and tell me the reason of its
being illuminated, now I am not there.</p>
<p>The grand vizier Giafar, upon this news, fell into a
violent trembling, fearing something else was the matter;
but, when he came nearer, and with his own
eyes saw the truth of what the caliph had told him,
he was more astonished than before. However, being
obliged to make some excuse to appease the caliph&rsquo;s
anger, he said, Commander of the true believers, all
that I can say to your majesty about this matter is,
that about five or six days ago, Scheich Ibrahim came
to acquaint me, that he had a design to call an assembly
of the ministers of his mosque, to assist at a
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
ceremony he was ambitious of performing in your
majesty&rsquo;s auspicious reign. I asked him if I could be
any way serviceable to him in this affair; upon which
he entreated me to get leave of your majesty to perform
the ceremony in the pavilion. When he left me,
I told him he might do it, and I would take care to
acquaint your majesty with it; but indeed I had
quite forgot it, and I heartily ask pardon. Scheich
Ibrahim, continued he, has certainly made choice of
this day for the ceremony; and, after treating the ministers
of his mosque, he was willing to divert them
with the sight of this illumination.</p>
<p>Giafar, said the caliph, with a tone that plainly
showed his anger was a little mollified, according to
thy own words, thou hast committed three faults that
are unpardonable: the first, in giving Scheich Ibrahim
leave to perform his ceremony in my pavilion; for a
person in so mean an office as his, is not worthy of so
great an honour: the second, in not acquainting me
with it: and the third, in not diving into the bottom
of the good old man&rsquo;s intention. For my part, I am
persuaded he only did it to try if he could get any
money towards bearing the charge of it; but perhaps
that never came into thy head: and sure I shall not
wrong him, in forgiving him the expense of the night&rsquo;s
illumination, which will be some amends for thy presenting
him with nothing.</p>
<p>The grand vizier Giafar, overjoyed to hear the caliph
put the matter upon that foot, very willingly owned
the faults he reproached him with, and freely confessed
he was to blame in not giving Scheich Ibrahim
a few pieces of gold. Since the case is so, added the
caliph, it is just that thou shouldst be punished for
thy mistakes; but thy punishment shall be light: thou
shalt spend the remainder of the night as I do, with
these honest souls, whose company I am very well
pleased with; and while I am putting on a citizen&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
habit, go thou and disguise thyself, with Mesrour, and
come both of you along with me. The vizier Giafar
told him it was late, and that all the company would
be gone before he could get thither; but the caliph
said he would positively go. The vizier, who knew
that not a syllable of what he said before was true,
began to be in great consternation; but there was no
reply to be made, and go he must.</p>
<p>The caliph then, disguised like a citizen, with the
grand vizier Giafar, and Mesrour, chief of the eunuchs,
stole out of the palace together. They rambled through
the streets of Bagdad, till at last they came to the garden:
the door, through the carelessness of Scheich
Ibrahim, was open, having forgot to shut it when he
came back from buying the wine. The caliph was
very angry at it: Giafar, said he to the grand vizier,
what excuse have you for the door&rsquo;s being open at this
unseasonable hour? Is it possible that Scheich Ibrahim
makes a custom of leaving it thus all night? No;
I rather believe the hurry of the feast has been the
occasion of this neglect.</p>
<p>The caliph went into the garden; and when he
came to the pavilion, resolving not to go into the hall
till he knew what they were doing there, he consulted
with the grand vizier, whether it was not his best way
to climb up into one of the trees that was near it, to
make a discovery. The grand vizier at last casting
his eye upon the door, perceived it stood half open,
and told the caliph of it. It seems Scheich Ibrahim
had left it so, when he was prevailed upon to come in
and bear Noureddin and the Fair Persian company.</p>
<p>The caliph laying aside his first design, stole softly
up to the hall-door, which standing half-open, he had
the conveniency of seeing all the company that were
within, without being discovered himself.</p>
<p>Never was any person so surprised as he, when he
saw a lady of an incomparable beauty, and a young,
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
handsome, fine-shaped man, sitting at the table, with
Scheich Ibrahim by them. Scheich Ibrahim had just
then got a cup in his hand: My dear creature, said
he to the Fair Persian, a right toper never drinks
without singing a brisk tune first. If you please to
hear, I will give you one of my best songs.</p>
<p>Scheich Ibrahim sang; and the caliph wondered
at it more, because till that very moment he never
knew any thing of his drinking wine, but always took
him for a grave solid man, as he seemed to be to
outward appearance. The caliph retired from the
door with the same caution as he made his approach
to it; and coming to the grand vizier Giafar, who was
standing upon the steps a little lower, Come up, said
he to him, and see if those within yonder are the ministers
of the mosque, as you would fain have me believe.</p>
<p>By the tone of the voice in which the caliph spoke
these last words, the vizier understood that things
went ill on his side: however, he went up the steps;
but when he had peeped in at the door, and saw
them all three sitting, and in that condition, he fell
a-trembling for fear of his life. He went back to
the caliph, but in so great a confusion, that he had
not a word to say to him. What riotous doings are
here? said the caliph to him: who are those people
that have presumed to take the liberty of diverting
themselves in my garden and pavilion? and how
durst Scheich Ibrahim give them admittance, and
partake of the diversion with them? However, I
must confess, I never saw two persons more beautiful,
or better paired, in my life; and therefore, before
I discover my anger, I will inform myself a little
better, and inquire who they are, and the reason of
their being here. He went to the door again, to observe
them more narrowly; and the vizier who followed,
stood behind him, and fixed his eyes upon
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
them. They both of them plainly heard every word
that Scheich Ibrahim spoke to the Fair Persian. Is
there any thing, my charming lady, wanting to render
the pleasures of this night complete? Nothing
but a lute, replied the Fair Persian; and methinks, if
you could get me one, all things would be very well.
Can you play upon it? said Scheich Ibrahim. Fetch
me one, replied the Fair Persian, and you shall hear
whether I can or not.</p>
<p>Scheich Ibrahim, without stirring very far from his
place, pulled a lute out of a cupboard, and presented
it to the Fair Persian, who began to put it in tune.
The caliph, in the mean time, turning to the grand
vizier; Giafar, said he, the young lady is going to
play upon the lute; and if she performs well, I will
forgive her, and the young man for her sake; but,
as for thee, thou mayest go hang thyself. Commander
of the true believers, replied the grand vizier,
if that is your intention I wish she may play ill.
Why so? said the caliph. Because, replied the
grand vizier, the longer we live in this world, the
more time we shall have to comfort ourselves with
the hopes of dying in good social company. The
caliph, who loved a jest dearly, began to laugh at
this repartee; and putting his ear to the open side
of the door, he listened to hear the Fair Persian
play.</p>
<p>The Fair Persian made such artful flourishes upon
the lute, that from the first moment of her touching
it, the caliph perceived that she did it with a masterly
hand. Afterwards, she began to sing; and
suiting her voice, which was admirably fine, to the
lute, she sang and played with so much skill and
sweetness, that the caliph was quite ravished to hear
her.</p>
<p>As soon as the Fair Persian had finished her song,
the caliph went down the steps, and the vizier Giafar
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
after him. When he came to the bottom, By my
soul, said he to the vizier, I never heard a more
charming voice, or a lute better touched in my life.
Isaac<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>,
that hitherto I thought the most skilful
player in the world, does not come up to her. In
short, I am so charmed with her music, that I must
hear her play before me; and therefore contrive
some way how to bring it about.</p>
<p>Commander of the true believers, said the grand
vizier, if you should go in, and Scheich Ibrahim
chance to know you, he would infallibly die with the
fright. I should be extremely concerned at that, replied
the caliph, and should be loath to be the occasion
of his death, after so many years&rsquo; service. But
there is a thought just come into my head, how to
compass my design: stay here with Mesrour, and
wait for me in the next alley till I come.</p>
<p>The neighbourhood of the Tigris had given the
caliph the conveniency of turning a sufficient quantity
of water under a stately bridge, well terraced,
into his garden, to make a fine canal, whither the
choicest fish of the whole river used to retire. The
fishermen knew it very well, and would have given
the world to fish there; but the caliph had expressly
charged Scheich Ibrahim not to suffer any of them
to come near it. However, that very night, a fisherman
passing by the garden door, which the caliph
had left open as he found it, made use of this opportunity,
and going in, went directly to the canal.</p>
<p>The fisherman immediately fell to work with his
casting-nets, and was just ready to draw them, when
the caliph, fearing what would be the effect of
Scheich Ibrahim&rsquo;s negligence, but willing to make
use of it, to bring his design about, came to the same
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
place. The fisherman, in spite of his disguise, knew
him, and throwing himself at his feet, humbly implored
his pardon, and excused himself upon account
of his poverty. Rise, saith the caliph, and be not
afraid; only draw your nets, that I may see what fish
you have got.</p>
<p>The fisherman, recovered of his fright, quickly
obeyed the caliph&rsquo;s orders. He drew out five or six
very large fishes; and the caliph, choosing the two
largest, tied them together by the head with a sprig
of a tree. After this, said he to the fisherman, Give
me thy clothes, and here take mine. The exchange
was soon made; and the caliph being dressed like a
fisherman, even to his boots and turban, Take thy
nets, said he to the fisherman, and get thee about
thy business.</p>
<p>When the fisherman, very well pleased with his
good fortune, was gone, the caliph, taking the two
fishes in his hand, went to look after the grand vizier
Giafar and Mesrour. He made a full stop at the
grand vizier, who, not knowing him, asked him what
he wanted, and bade him go about his business.
Upon this, the caliph fell a-laughing; by which the
vizier finding it to be him, Commander of the true
believers, said he, is it possible it can be you? I
knew you not; and I ask a thousand pardons for my
rudeness: you are so strangely disguised now, that
without any fear of being discovered by Scheich
Ibrahim, you may venture into the hall. Stay you
here with Mesrour, said the caliph, while I go yonder
and play my part.</p>
<p>The caliph went up to the hall, and knocked at
the door. Noureddin hearing him first, told Scheich
Ibrahim of it, who asked who was there. The caliph
opened the door, and stepping a little way into
the hall to show himself, Scheich Ibrahim, said he, I
am the fisherman Kerim, who being informed of your
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
design to treat some of your friends, have brought
two very large fishes, fresh caught, to see if you have
any occasion for them.</p>
<p>Noureddin and the Fair Persian, mightily pleased
to hear him name fish, Pray, said she to Scheich
Ibrahim, let him come in, that we may look upon
them. Scheich Ibrahim, by this time, was incapable
of asking this counterfeit fisherman how or what
way he came thither; but his whole design being
only to oblige the Fair Persian, with much ado he
turns his head towards the door, being quite drunk,
and in a stammering tone, calling to the caliph,
whom he took to be a fisherman, Come hither, thou
nightly thief, said he, and let us see what thou hast
got.</p>
<p>The caliph went forwards, and counterfeiting all
the humours and actions of a fisherman to a nicety,
presented them with the two fishes. These are very
fine ones indeed, said the Fair Persian; and if they
were well ordered, and delicately dressed, I should
be glad to eat some of them. The lady is in the
right, answered Scheich Ibrahim; but what the
plague can we do with your fish, unless it was dressed?
Go, dress it thyself, and bring it to us; thou
wilt find every thing necessary for thee in my
kitchen.</p>
<p>The caliph went back to the grand vizier: Giafar,
said he, I have been very well received; but they
want the fish to be dressed. I will take care to dress
it myself, said the grand vizier, and they shall have
it in a moment. Nay, replied the caliph, so eager
am I to accomplish my design, that I will take
abundance of pains about it too; for since I have
personated the fisherman so well, sure I can play the
cook for once: besides, in my younger days, I dealt
a little in cookery, and always came off with flying
colours. In saying these words, he went directly towards
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
Scheich Ibrahim&rsquo;s lodgings, and the grand
vizier and Mesrour followed him.</p>
<p>All three of them presently fell to work, and
though Scheich Ibrahim&rsquo;s kitchen was not very large,
yet there was every thing in it that they wanted.
The fish was quickly cooked, and the caliph served
it up, putting to every one&rsquo;s plate a lemon to squeeze,
if they thought it proper, into the sauce. They all
ate very heartily, but especially Noureddin and the
Fair Persian; and the caliph sat down with them at
the lower end of the table.</p>
<p>As soon as the repast was over, Noureddin looking
upon the caliph, Fisherman, said he, never were
better fish eaten, and you have done us the greatest
favour in the world. At the same time putting his
hand into his bosom, and pulling out a purse of
thirty pieces of gold, the remainder of the forty that
Sangiar, gentleman-usher to the king of Balsora, had
given him just upon his departure; Here, said he to
him, take that, and if I had any more, thou shouldst
have it: had I known thee in my prosperity, I would
have taken care of securing thee from ever wanting:
do not refuse the small present I make thee, but accept
of it as kindly as if it was much greater.</p>
<p>The caliph took the purse, and perceiving by the
weightiness that it was all gold, Sir, said he, I cannot
enough thank you for your liberality, and I think
myself very fortunate in having to do with a person
of your generosity; but before I take my leave, I
have a favour to ask, which I beg you not to deny
me. Yonder is a lute, which makes me believe that
the lady understands playing upon it; and if you can
prevail with her to play but one tune, I shall go away
the best satisfied in the world: a lute, sir, is an instrument
I greatly admire.</p>
<p>Fair Persian, said Noureddin, immediately addressing
himself to her, I ask that favour of you,
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
and I hope you will not refuse me. She took up the
lute without more entreaties, and putting it presently
in tune, played and sang with such an air as charmed
the very soul of the caliph with its harmony. Afterwards
she played upon the lute without singing, but
with so much skill and softness that it transported
him into an ecstasy of joy.</p>
<p>When the Fair Persian had given over playing, the
caliph cried out, What a voice! What a hand! What
skill is here! Was there ever finer singing, or better
playing upon the lute? Never was there any heard
or seen like it.</p>
<p>Noureddin, who was a person of breeding, and
always returned the compliment that was made him;
Fisherman, said he, I find thou hast some taste for
music, since thou art delighted with her performance;
and if thou likest her she is thine; I make
thee a present of her. At the same time he rose up,
and taking his robe, which he had laid by, was for
going away and leaving the pretended fisherman in
possession of the Fair Persian.</p>
<p>The Fair Persian was extremely surprised at Noureddin&rsquo;s
liberality; she took hold of him, and looking
very wishfully at him, Whither, sir, are you
going? said she; sit down in your place, I entreat
you, and hearken to the song I am going to sing and
play. He did as she desired him, and then the Fair
Persian touching her lute, and looking upon him with
tears, sang some verses that she had made <i>extempore</i>
to reproach him with his indifference, and the
easiness as well as cruelty of resigning her to Kerim.
She only hinted, without explaining herself any farther
to the fisherman, for she was ignorant of his
being the caliph, as well as Noureddin. When she
had done playing, she put the lute down by her, and
clapped a handkerchief to her face to hide the tears
she could not help shedding.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>Noureddin made no answer to all these reproaches,
but by his silence seemed to declare he did not repent
of what he had done. The caliph surprised at
what he had newly heard, Sir, said he, as far as I
see, this beautiful lady, that so generously you have
made me a present of just now, is your slave, and
you are her master. It is very true, Kerim, replied
Noureddin, and thou wouldst be more surprised than
thou art now, should I tell thee all the misfortunes
that have happened to me on her account. Ah! I
beseech you, sir, replied the caliph, still behaving
himself like a fisherman, oblige me so far as to let me
hear part of your story.</p>
<p>Noureddin, who had already obliged him in several
things of a higher nature than this, was so complaisant
as to relate the whole story to him. He began with
his father&rsquo;s buying the Fair Persian for the king of
Balsora, and omitted nothing of what he had done,
or what had happened to him, from that time to
their arrival at Bagdad, and since, to that very moment
he was talking to him.</p>
<p>When Noureddin had ended his story, Whither
are you going now? said the caliph. Even where
Heaven shall direct me, answered Noureddin. Believe
me, replied the caliph, you shall go no farther,
but on the contrary, return to Balsora: I will go and
write a short letter, which you shall give the king in
my name; and you shall see upon the reading of it,
he will give you a very handsome reception, and nobody
will dare to speak against you.</p>
<p>Kerim, said Noureddin, what thou hast told me is
very unaccountable and singular: didst thou ever hear
that a poor fisherman, as thou art, had any correspondence
with a king? Be not astonished at that,
replied the caliph; you must know then, that we
both studied together under the same masters, and
were always the best friends in the world. It is
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
true, fortune has not been equally favourable to us
both; she has made him a king, and me but a fisherman.
However, this inequality has not at all lessened
our friendship: he has often expressed a readiness
and desire to advance my fortune, but I
always refused it; and am better pleased with the
satisfaction of knowing that he never will deny me
whatever I ask for the service and advantage of my
friends. Let me do it then, and you shall see the
success.</p>
<p>Noureddin consented to what the caliph had proposed;
and there being every thing necessary for
writing in the hall, the caliph wrote a letter to the
king of Balsora; at the top of which, pretty near the
edge of the paper, he placed this set form, in three
small characters: &lsquo;In the name of the most merciful
God,&rsquo; to show he would be absolutely obeyed.</p>
<h3 title="">THE LETTER OF CALIPH HAROUN ALRASCHID TO THE KING OF BALSORA</h3>
<p>&lsquo;Haroun Alraschid, son of Mandi, sends this
letter to Mohammed Zinchi, his cousin, greeting.
As soon as Noureddin, son to the late vizier Khacan,
the bearer, has delivered you this letter and
you have read it, pull off the royal mantle, put it on
his shoulders, and place him in thy seat: fail not.
So farewell.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The caliph folded up the letter, and sealed it, and
giving it to Noureddin, without saying any thing of
what was in it, Go, said he, and embark immediately
in a vessel that is ready to go off, (as there did constantly
every day at the same hour), and you may
sleep when you are aboard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>Noureddin took the letter, and away he went with
the little money he had about him when Sangiar
gave him his purse; and the Fair Persian, distracted
with grief at his departure, retired by herself to one
of the sofas, and fell a-weeping bitterly.</p>
<p>Noureddin was scarce gone out of the hall, when
Scheich Ibrahim, who had been silent during the
transaction of this affair, looking steadfastly upon
the caliph, whom he still believed to be a fisherman:
Hark you, said he, Kerim, thou hast brought us two
fishes that are worth twenty pieces of leather or
more, and thou hast got a purse and a slave: but
dost thou think to have it all for thyself? I here declare
that I will go halves with thee in the slave; and
as for the purse, show me what is in the inside: if
it is silver, thou shalt have one piece for thyself;
but if it is gold, I will have it all, and in exchange,
give thee some pieces of leather I have in my
pocket.</p>
<p>(For the better understanding of what follows,
said Scheherazade, interrupting herself here, we
must observe to you, that the caliph, before his serving
up the fish, had despatched the grand vizier
Giafar to his palace, with orders to get four slaves
with a rich habit, and to wait on the other side of
the pavilion till he gave a signal with his finger
against the window. The grand vizier receiving his
commission, he, Mesrour, and the four slaves, waited
at the appointed place, expecting the sign).</p>
<p>The caliph, still personating the fisherman, answered
Scheich Ibrahim very boldly, I know not
what there is in the purse, gold or silver: whatever
it is, you shall freely go my halves; but, as to the
slave, I will have her all to myself; and if you will
not accept of these conditions, you shall have nothing
at all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>Scheich Ibrahim, enraged to the last degree at
this insolence, considering him only as a fisherman,
snatched up one of the china dishes, and flung it at
the caliph&rsquo;s head. The caliph easily avoided the
blow, being thrown by a person in drink; but the
dish striking against the wall, was dashed into a
thousand pieces. Scheich Ibrahim having missed
his aim, grew more enraged, and catching up the
candle that stood upon the table, rose from his seat,
and staggering along, went down a back pair of stairs
to look for a cane.</p>
<p>The caliph made use of this opportunity, and
striking his hands against the window, the grand
vizier, Mesrour, and the four slaves were with him
in a trice, who quickly pulled off the fisherman&rsquo;s
clothes, and put on him the habit they had brought.
They had not quite dressed the caliph, (who had
seated himself upon the throne that was in the hall),
but they were very busy about him, when Scheich
Ibrahim, spurred on by interest, came back, with a
swinging cane in his hand, with which he designed to
pay the pretended fisherman soundly; but, instead
of finding him, he saw his clothes in the middle of
the hall, and the caliph upon his throne, with the
grand vizier and Mesrour on each side of him. He
stood a while gazing upon this unexpected sight,
doubting whether he was awake or asleep. The caliph
fell a-laughing at his astonishment; and, calling
to him, Scheich Ibrahim, said he, what dost thou
want? whom dost thou look after?</p>
<p>Scheich Ibrahim, no longer doubting that it was
the caliph, immediately threw himself at his feet,
with his face to the ground: Commander of the true
believers, cried he, your vile slave has offended you;
but he implores your clemency, and asks a thousand
pardons for his offence. As soon as the slaves had
made an end of dressing him, he came down from his
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
throne, and advancing towards him, Rise, said he; I
forgive thee.</p>
<p>Afterwards the caliph addressed himself to the
Fair Persian, who had suspended her sorrow, as soon
as she understood that the garden and pavilion belonged
to that prince, and not to Scheich Ibrahim, as
he had all along made her believe, and that it was he
himself disguised in the fisherman&rsquo;s clothes. Fair
Persian, said he, rise and follow me: by what you
have lately seen, you ought to know who I am, and
to believe that I am above taking any advantage of
Noureddin&rsquo;s humour, who, with a generosity not to
be paralleled, has made me a present of your person.
I have sent him to Balsora to be king there; and
when I have despatched some business necessary for
his establishment, you shall also go thither and be a
queen. In the mean time, I am going to order an
apartment for you in my palace, where you shall be
treated according to your desert.</p>
<p>This discourse put the Fair Persian in heart again,
and comforted her after a very sensible manner. The
joy of Noureddin&rsquo;s advancement, whom she passionately
loved, to so high an honour, made her sufficient
amends for her affliction. The caliph kept his promise,
and recommended her to the care of his lady
Zobeide, whom he acquainted with the esteem he had
lately entertained for Noureddin.</p>
<p>Noureddin&rsquo;s return to Balsora was more fortunate
and speedier by some days than he could have expected.
Upon his arrival, without visiting any of
his friends or relations, he went directly to the palace,
where the king at that time was giving public
audience. He pressed through the crowd with the
letter held up in his hand, who presently made way
for him to come forward and deliver it. The king
took and opened it; and his colour changed in reading
it: he kissed it thrice, and was just about to
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
obey the caliph&rsquo;s orders, when he bethought himself
of showing it to the vizier Saouy, Noureddin&rsquo;s irreconcileable
enemy.</p>
<p>Saouy, who had discovered Noureddin, and began
to think with himself, with a great deal of uneasiness,
what might be the design of his coming, was
no less surprised than the king, at the order contained
in the letter; and being as much concerned in
it, he thought upon a way that very moment how to
evade it. He pretended not to have read the letter
quite through, and therefore desired a second view of
it; he turned himself a little on one side, as if he
wanted a better sight, and without being perceived
by any body, dexterously tore off the set form that
showed the caliph would be absolutely obeyed, from
the top of it, and putting it into his mouth, swallowed
it down.</p>
<p>After this notorious piece of villany, Saouy turned
to the king, and giving him the letter, Sir, said he
to him, in a low voice, what does your majesty intend
to do? What the caliph has commanded me, replied
the king. Have a care, sir, said the wicked vizier,
what you do: it is true, this is the caliph&rsquo;s hand;
but the set form is not to it. The king had observed
that very well, but in the confusion he was in, he
thought his eyes deceived him, when he saw it was
gone.</p>
<p>Sir, continued the vizier, we have no reason to
doubt, but that the caliph upon the complaints he
has made against your majesty and me, has granted
him this letter purely to get rid of him, not with any
intention of having the order contained in it executed.
Besides, we must consider, he has sent no
express with a patent: and without that, the order is
of no force: and since a king of your majesty&rsquo;s grandeur
was never deposed without that formality, let
who will bring such a letter as this, it ought not to
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
be put in execution. Your majesty may depend upon
what I have said; and how dangerous soever the consequence
of disobeying this order may be, I will take
it all upon myself.</p>
<p>King Zinchi, easily persuaded by this pernicious
counsel, left Noureddin entirely to the discretion of
the vizier Saouy, who led him to his house after a
very insulting manner; where, after causing him to
be bastinadoed till he was almost dead, he ordered
him to a prison, where he commanded him to be put
in the darkest dungeon, with a strict charge to the
gaoler to give him nothing but bread and water.</p>
<p>When Noureddin, sadly bruised with the strokes,
came to himself, and found what a nasty dungeon he
was in, he bewailed his misfortunes after the most
pathetic manner imaginable. Ah! fisherman, cried
he, how hast thou cheated me; and how easy have I
been in believing thee! Could I, after the civility
I showed thee, expect so inhuman and barbarous
usage! However, may Heaven reward thee: for I
cannot persuade myself, that thy intention was so
base, and I will with patience wait the end of my
afflictions.</p>
<p>The poor disconsolate Noureddin remained six
whole days in this miserable condition, and Saouy
did not forget that he had confined him there, but
being resolved to put him to a shameful death, and
not daring to do it by his own authority, to accomplish
his villanous design, he ordered some of his
slaves to prepare some very rich presents, which he,
at the head of them, went and presented to the king,
saying, Behold, sir, what the new king hath sent you
upon his accession to the crown, and begs your majesty
to accept of it.</p>
<p>The king taking the matter just as Saouy intended
it, What! replied he, is the wretch still living? I
thought you had put him to death already. Sir, I
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
have no power, answered the vizier, to take any person&rsquo;s
life away; that only belongs to your majesty.
Go, said the king, behead him instantly; I give you
full authority. Sir, replied the vizier Saouy, I am
infinitely obliged to your majesty for the justice you
do me; but, since Noureddin has publicly affronted
me, I humbly beg the favour that his execution may
be performed before the palace, and, that the criers
may publish it in every quarter of the city, that every
body may be satisfied that he has made sufficient
reparation for the affront. The king granted the
request, and the criers, in performing their office,
diffused a universal sorrow through the whole city.
The memory of his father&rsquo;s virtues being yet fresh
among them, there was no one could hear of the ignominious
death the son was going to suffer, through
the villany and instigation of the vizier Saouy, without
horror and indignation.</p>
<p>Saouy went in person to the prison, accompanied
with twenty slaves, his ministers of cruelty, who took
Noureddin out of his dungeon, and put him on a
shabby horse without a saddle. When Noureddin
saw himself in the hands of his enemy, Thou triumphest
now, said he, but thou abusest thy power.
Yet, I have still some confidence in the truth of what
is written in one of our books: &lsquo;You judge unjustly,
and in a little time you shall be judged yourself.&rsquo; The
vizier Saouy, who really triumphed in his heart,
What! insolent, said he, darest thou insult me yet?
but go, I pardon thee, and care not whatever happens
to me, so I have the pleasure of seeing thee lose thy
head in the public view of all Balsora. Thou oughtest
also to remember what another of our books says:
&lsquo;What signifies dying the next day the death of his
enemy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The vizier, still implacable and full of malice, surrounded
by one part of his slaves in arms, ordered
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
Noureddin to be conducted by the other towards the
palace. The people were ready to fall upon him as
they went along; and, if any body had set them the
example, they would certainly have stoned him to
death. When he had brought him to the place of
suffering, which was in sight of the king&rsquo;s apartment,
he left him in the executioner&rsquo;s hands, and went
straight to the king, who was in his closet ready to
glut his eyes with the bloody spectacle he had prepared.</p>
<p>The king&rsquo;s guard and the vizier&rsquo;s slaves, who made
a circle round Noureddin, had much ado to withstand
the people, who made all the efforts possible,
but in vain, to break through them and carry him off
by force. The executioner coming up to him, Sir,
said he, I hope you will forgive me; I am but a slave,
and cannot help doing my duty. If you have no occasion
for any thing, I beseech you prepare yourself,
for the king is just going to give me orders to strike
the blow.</p>
<p>The poor unfortunate Noureddin, at that cruel moment,
looked round upon the people: Will no charitable
body, cried he, bring me a little water to quench
my thirst? which immediately they did, and handed
it up to him upon the scaffold. The vizier Saouy, perceiving
this delay, called out to the executioner from
the king&rsquo;s closet window, where he had planted himself,
Strike, what dost thou stay for? At these barbarous
and inhuman words the whole palace echoed
with loud imprecations against him; and the king,
jealous of his authority, made it appear, by ordering
him to stay a while, that he was angry at his presumption.
But there was another reason; for the
king that very moment casting his eyes up into a
large street that faced him and joined to the place of
execution, saw about the middle of it a troop of
horsemen coming with full speed towards the palace.
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
Vizier, said the king immediately, look yonder, what
is the meaning of those horsemen? Saouy, who knew
not what it might be, earnestly pressed the king to
give the executioner the sign. No, replied the king,
I will first see who these horsemen are. It was the
vizier Giafar and his train, who came in person from
Bagdad by the caliph&rsquo;s order.</p>
<p>To make the occasion of this minister&rsquo;s coming to
Balsora a little plainer, we must observe, that after
Noureddin&rsquo;s departure with the caliph&rsquo;s letter, the
caliph the next day, nor several days after, ever
thought of sending the patent that he mentioned to
the Fair Persian. He happened one day to be in the
inner palace, which was the women&rsquo;s, and passing by
the apartment, he heard the sound of a fine voice: he
listened to it, and he had no sooner heard the words
of one complaining for the absence of somebody, than
he asked the officer of his eunuchs that attended him,
who that woman was that belonged to that apartment.
The officer told him that it was the young
stranger&rsquo;s slave, whom he had sent to Balsora to be
king in the room of Mohammed Zinchi.</p>
<p>Ah! poor Noureddin, cried the caliph presently, I
had forgot thee; but haste, said he to the officer, and
bid Giafar come to me. The vizier was with him in
an instant. As soon as he came, Giafar, said he, I
have hitherto neglected sending the patent to Noureddin,
which was to confirm him king of Balsora;
but we have no time now to draw up one, therefore
immediately take post-horses, and, with some of your
servants, make what haste you can to Balsora. If
Noureddin is dead, and put to death by them, order
the vizier Saouy to be hanged; but, if he be living,
bring him to me with the king and the vizier.</p>
<p>The grand vizier staid no longer than just the time
of getting on horseback, and being attended by a
great train of officers belonging to his house, he set
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
forward for Balsora, where he arrived after the manner,
and at the time above mentioned. As soon as he
came to the palace-yard the people cleared the way
for him, crying out, A pardon for Noureddin! and
with his whole train he rode into the palace, even to
the very stairs, where he alighted.</p>
<p>The king of Balsora knowing him to be the caliph&rsquo;s
chief minister, went to meet him, and received him at
the entrance of his apartment. The first question the
vizier asked was, if Noureddin was living; and, if he
was, that he might be sent for. The king made answer,
He was alive, and gave orders to have him
brought in. Accordingly he soon made his appearance
as he was, tied, and bound with cords. The
grand vizier Giafar caused him to be untied, and setting
him at liberty, ordered the vizier Saouy to be
seized, and bound with the same cords.</p>
<p>The grand vizier Giafar lay but one night in Balsora.
The next day he set out again for Bagdad;
and, according to the order he had received, carried
Saouy, the king of Balsora, and Noureddin along with
him. As soon as he came to Bagdad, he presented
them all to the caliph; and after he had given him an
account of his journey, and particularly of the miserable
condition he found Noureddin in, and that all his
ill usage was purely by the advice and malice of
Saouy, the caliph desired Noureddin to behead the
vizier himself. Commander of the true believers, said
Noureddin, notwithstanding the injury this wicked
man has done me, and the mischief he endeavoured to
do my deceased father, I should think myself the
basest of mankind if I had stained my hands with his
blood. The caliph was extremely pleased with his
generosity, and ordered justice to be done by the executioner&rsquo;s
hand.</p>
<p>The caliph would fain have sent Noureddin back to
Balsora to have been king there; but Noureddin humbly
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
begged to be excused from accepting the offer,
saying, Commander of the true believers, the city of
Balsora, after the misfortunes that have happened to
me there, is so much my aversion, and will always
continue to be so, that I beseech your majesty to give
me leave to keep the oath I have made of never returning
thither again: and I shall think it my greatest
glory to do you some services near your royal person,
if you are pleased to do me the honour. The caliph
consented to it; and placing him among the number
of those courtiers who were his greatest favourites,
restored the Fair Persian to him again. To all these
favours he added a plentiful fortune; and he and the
Fair Persian lived together to their dying day, with
all the satisfaction they could both desire.</p>
<p>As for the king of Balsora, the caliph contented
himself with only letting him see how careful he ought
to be in the choice of his viziers, and so sent him
back into his kingdom.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><br />THE STORY OF
<br />BEDER, PRINCE OF PERSIA, AND GIAHAURE, PRINCESS OF SAMARCAND.</h2>
<p>Persia is a country of so vast extent, that their
ancient monarchs have, not without some colour of
reason, assumed the haughty title of king of kings.
For, not to mention those nations subdued by their
arms, there are whole kingdoms and provinces whose
kings are not only tributary, but also in as great subjection
to them as petty governors in other nations
are to kings.</p>
<p>Some ages ago one of these kings, who, in the beginning
of his reign, had signalized himself by many
glorious and successful conquests, enjoyed so profound
and lasting a peace and tranquillity as rendered
him the happiest of monarchs. The only thing
in which he could be termed unfortunate was, that
amongst all his mistresses not one of them ever
brought him a son; and being now far advanced in
years, he was desirous of an heir to succeed him after
his death. However, he had above a hundred ladies
all lodged in separate apartments, after a magnificent
manner, with women slaves and eunuchs to wait upon
and take care of them. Yet, notwithstanding all
his endeavours to please and humour them in every
thing, there was not one that answered his expectation.
He had women very often brought him from
the most remote countries, and if they pleased him,
he not only gave the merchants their full price at the
first word, but treated them with all respect and civility
imaginable, and by considerable presents obliged
them still to bring others, flattering himself, that at
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
last he might be so happy as to meet with one by
whom he might have a son. There was scarce any
act of charity but what he performed, fancying by
that means to prevail with Heaven. He gave immense
sums to the poor, besides large donatives to
the religious of his own persuasion, building for their
use many noble colleges richly endowed, in hopes of
obtaining by their prayers what he earnestly desired.</p>
<p>One day, according to the custom of his royal predecessors,
during their residence in the capital city,
he gave his mistresses a ball, at which all the ambassadors
and strangers of quality about the court were
present; and where they not only entertained one
another with talking of news and politics, but also of
learning, history, poetry, and whatever else was capable
of diverting the understanding after the most
agreeable manner. It was upon that day that an
eunuch came to acquaint him with the arrival of a certain
merchant from a far country, who, having brought
a slave along with him, desired leave to show her to
his majesty. Give him admittance instantly, says the
king, and after the ball is done I will talk with him:
the merchant was introduced, and seated in a convenient
place, from whence he might easily have a full
view of the king, and hear him talk with abundance
of familiarity to those that stood near his person. The
king was extremely civil in his conversation with
strangers, with a design, that by degrees they might
grow acquainted with him; so that when they saw
with what freedom and civility he addressed himself
to the whole assembly, they took courage and began
to discourse with him also, without being the least
surprised at the dazzling pomp and splendour of his
appearance, which was enough to deprive those of
their power of speech that were not used to such glorious
sights. He treated the ambassadors also after
the same manner: first he ate with them, and during
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
the repast, he asked them several questions concerning
their health, of their voyage, and the affairs of
their country; and, after they had been encouraged
by his generous entertainment, he gave them audience.</p>
<p>When the ball was over, all the company retired;
the merchant, who was the only person left, fell prostrate
before the king&rsquo;s throne with his face to the
earth, wishing his majesty an accomplishment of all
his desires. As soon as he rose up, the king asked
him if the news of his having brought a slave for him
was true, and whether she was handsome.</p>
<p>Sir, replied the merchant, I doubt not in the least
but your majesty has very beautiful women, since you
search every corner of the earth for them; but I may
boldly affirm, without overvaluing my merchandise,
that you never saw a woman that could stand in competition
with her for shape and beauty, besides a
thousand other agreeable qualifications that she is
mistress of. Where is she? says the king; bring her
to me instantly. Sir, replied the merchant, I have
delivered her into the hands of one of your chief
eunuchs, and your majesty may send for her at your
pleasure.</p>
<p>The fair slave was immediately brought in, and no
sooner had the king cast his eyes on her, than the genteelness
of her mien and shape charmed him. He
went presently into his closet, whither the merchant,
with a few eunuchs, followed him. The slave wore a
red satin veil, striped with gold, over her face; and
when the merchant had taken it off, the king of Persia
beheld a lady that surpassed in beauty, not only
his present mistresses, but even all that ever he had
before; in short, he immediately fell passionately in
love with her, and bade the merchant name his price.</p>
<p>Sir, said he, I gave a thousand pieces of gold to
the persons of whom I bought her, and in my three
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
years&rsquo; journey to your court, I have spent as much:
but I shall forbear setting any price to so great a
monarch; and, therefore, if your majesty likes her, I
humbly beg you would accept of her as a present. I
am highly obliged to you, replied the king; but it is
never my custom to treat merchants, who come hither
purely for my pleasure, after so ungenerous a manner.
I am going to order thee ten thousand pieces
of gold; therefore speak, whether thou art pleased
with that sum or not. Sir, answered the merchant,
though I should have esteemed myself very happy in
your majesty&rsquo;s acceptance of her for nothing, yet I
dare not refuse so generous an offer. I shall take
care to publish it, not only in my own country, but
also in every place through which I pass. The money
was presently paid him; and, before he stirred out of
his presence, the king made him put on a rich suit of
cloth of gold.</p>
<p>The king caused the fair slave to be lodged in the
finest apartment next his own, and gave particular
orders to the matrons and to the women slaves appointed
to attend her, that after bathing they should
dress her in the richest clothes the kingdom afforded.
He also commanded them to carry her some pearl-necklaces,
with abundance of diamonds, and other
precious stones, that she might have the liberty of
choosing those she liked best.</p>
<p>The officious matrons, whose only care it was to
please the king, were astonished with admiration at
her beauty; and being well skilled in that affair, they
told his majesty, that, if he would allow them but
three days, they would engage to make her so much
handsomer than she was at present, that he should
scarce know her again. The king at first was very
loath to defer the pleasure of enjoyment so long; but
at last he consented, upon condition they would be
as good as their word.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>The king of Persia&rsquo;s capital was situated in an
island, and his palace, which was very magnificent,
was built upon the sea-shore: his apartment looked
upon that element; and the fair slave&rsquo;s, which was
pretty near it, had also the same prospect; and it
was the more agreeable upon the account of the sea
beating almost against the foot of the wall.</p>
<p>At the three days&rsquo; end, the fair slave, gloriously
dressed and set off, was alone in her chamber, sitting
upon a sofa, and leaning against one of the windows
that faced the sea, when the king, being informed
that he might visit her, came in. The slave hearing
somebody walk in the room, with an air quite different
from that of the women slaves who had hitherto attended
her, immediately turned her head about to see
who it was. She knew him to be the king; but without
discovering the least surprise, or so much as rising
from her seat to salute or receive him, as if he had
been the meanest person in the world, she put herself
in the same posture again.</p>
<p>The king of Persia was extremely surprised to see
a slave of so beauteous a form so ignorant of the
world. He attributed this piece of ill breeding to
the narrowness of her education, and the little care
that was taken of instructing her at first in the rules
of civility and good manners. He went to her at the
window, where, notwithstanding the coldness and indifferency
with which she had just now received him,
she suffered herself to be admired, caressed, and embraced,
as much as he pleased.</p>
<p>In the midst of these amorous embraces and tender
endearments, this monarch paused a while to gaze
upon, or rather to devour her with his eyes: My
goddess! my angel! my charmer! cried the king;
whence came you? and where do those happy parents
live that brought into the world so surprising a
masterpiece of nature as you are? Ah! how I adore
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
you! and my passion shall continue the same. Never
did I feel for a woman what I now suffer for you: and
though I have seen, and do see every day, a vast number
of beauties, yet never did my eyes behold so many
charms in one single person, which have so transported
me out of myself, that I am no longer at my
own, but entirely at your disposal. My dearest life,
continued he, you neither answer me, nor by any visible
token give me the least reason to believe that you
are sensible of the many demonstrations I have given
you of the violence of my passion; neither will you
turn your eyes on me, to afford mine the pleasure of
meeting them with an amorous glance, and to convince
you that it is impossible to love more than I do
you. Why will you still keep this obstinate silence,
which freezes me to death? and whence proceeds the
seriousness, or rather sorrow, that torments me to the
soul? Do you mourn for your country, your friends,
or your relations? Alas! is not the king of Persia,
who loves and adores you, capable of comforting and
making you amends for the loss of every thing in the
world?</p>
<p>What protestations of love soever the king of Persia
made the fair slave to oblige her to speak to him,
she continued her astonishing reservedness, and keeping
her eyes still fixed on the ground, would not so
much as open her lips.</p>
<p>The king of Persia, charmed with the purchase he
had made of a slave that pleased him so well, pressed
her no farther, in hopes that, by treating her civilly,
he might prevail upon her to change her mind. He
presently gave the usual sign to the women that
waited in an outward room; and as soon as they entered,
he commanded them to bring in supper. When
it was on the table, My dear, said he to the slave,
come hither and sup with me. She rose up from her
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
seat, and being placed over against the king, his majesty
helped her before he began eating himself; and
so he did of every dish during the whole supper. The
slave ate with downcast eyes, and without speaking
one word, though he often asked her how she liked
the entertainment, and whether it was dressed to her
taste.</p>
<p>The king, willing to change the discourse, asked
her what her name was, how she liked the clothes
and the jewels she had on, what she thought of her
apartment and the rich furniture, and whether the
prospect of the sea was not very agreeable and charming.
But to all these questions she answered not a
word; so that the king was at a loss what to think of
her silence. He imagined at first, that perhaps she
might be dumb: But then, said he to himself, can it
be possible that Heaven should form a creature so
beautiful, so perfect, and so accomplished, and yet at
the same time with so great an imperfection? However,
I cannot love with less passion than I do.</p>
<p>When the king of Persia rose from the table, he
washed his hands on one side, while the fair slave
washed hers on the other. He took that time to ask
the women that held the basin and the towel, if ever
they had heard her speak. One of them presently
made answer, Sir, we have neither seen her open her
lips, nor heard her speak, any more than your majesty
has just now: we have taken care of her in the
bath, we have combed and dressed her head, put on
her clothes, and waited upon her in her chamber;
but she has never opened her lips, so much as to say,
That is well, or, I like this. We have often asked her,
Madam, do you want any thing? let us know what
you would have; do but ask, and we are ready to get
it for you: but we have never been able to draw a
word from her; so that we cannot tell whether her
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
silence proceeds from pride, sorrow, stupidity, or
dumbness; and this is all we can inform your majesty.</p>
<p>The king of Persia was more astonished at hearing
this than he was before: however, believing the slave
might have some reason for her sorrow, he was willing
to endeavour to divert it, and make her merry.
Accordingly, he made a very splendid ball, to which
all the fine ladies of the court came, and those who
were skilful in playing upon musical instruments
showed their parts, while others sang or danced, or
did both together: in short, they played at a great
many sorts of games, which mightily diverted the king.
The fair slave was the only person that took no pleasure
in those diversions: she never stirred out of her
place, but with her eyes still fixed on the ground,
without taking any notice of the entertainment, behaved
herself with so much indifferency that all the
ladies were no less surprised at it than the king.
After the ball was done, every one retired to her
apartment; and the king, who was left alone with
the fair slave, lay with her that night.</p>
<p>The next morning, the king of Persia arose more
pleased than he had been with all the women he
had ever seen, and more enamoured with the fair
slave than he was before. Indeed, he soon made it
appear, by resolving henceforth to keep constant to
her; and he performed his resolution. On the very
same day he dismissed all his other women, giving
every one of them their jewels and other valuable
things, besides a considerable fortune, with free leave
to marry whom they thought fit, and only kept the
matrons, and a few other old women, to wait upon
and attend the fair slave. However, for a whole year
together, she never afforded him the pleasure of one
single word; yet the king took abundance of pains to
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
please her, and, with all complaisance imaginable, to
give her the most signal proofs of his violent passion.</p>
<p>The year was now expired, when the king, sitting
one day by his mistress, protested to her that his
love, instead of being diminished, grew every day
more violent: My queen, said he, I cannot conceive
what your thoughts are; but, however, nothing is
more true, and I swear to you the same, that in having
the happiness of possessing you, there remains
nothing for me to desire: I esteem my kingdom, great
as it is, less than an atom, when I have the pleasure
of beholding your eyes, and of telling you a thousand
times how I adore you. You see I have given you
some other proofs of my affection than bare words;
and therefore surely you can never doubt of it, after
the vast number of women I have sacrificed to your
beauty. You may remember, it is about a year since
I sent them away from my court; and I repent of it as
little even now I am talking with you, as I did the
first moment of their departure, and I believe I never
shall. Nothing would be wanting to complete my
happiness, and crown my joys for ever, would you
speak but one single word to me, by which I might
be assured that you thought yourself in some measure
obliged to me. But how can you speak to me if you
are dumb? and alas! how fearful I am lest it should
be true! yet what reason have I to doubt of it, since
you still torment me with silence, after a whole year&rsquo;s
entreating you every hour to speak to me! However,
if it is impossible for me to obtain that consolation,
may Heaven, at least, grant me the blessing
of a son by you to succeed me after my death. I find
myself growing old every day, and I begin to want
one to assist me in bearing the weight of a crown.
But still I cannot refrain from the desire I have of
hearing you speak; for methinks something within
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
me tells me you are not dumb; and, therefore, dear
madam, I beseech, I conjure you, to break through
this obstinate humour, and speak but one word to
me; and after that, I care not how soon I die.</p>
<p>At this discourse, the fair slave, who, according to
her usual custom, had hearkened to the king with
downcast eyes, and had given him cause to believe,
not only that she was dumb, but that she never had
laughed in her life, began to look up and smile a little.
The king of Persia perceived it with a surprise that
made him break forth into an exclamation of joy; and
no longer doubting but that she was going to speak,
he waited for that happy moment with an eagerness
and attention that cannot be easily expressed.</p>
<p>At last, the fair slave, breaking her long silence,
thus addressed herself to the king: Sir, said she, I
have so many things to say to your majesty, that,
having once broke silence, I know not where to
begin. However, in the first place, I think myself
obliged in duty to thank your majesty for all the
favours and honours you have been pleased to confer
upon me, and to implore the gods to bless and prosper
you, to prevent the wicked designs and intentions
of your enemies, and that they would not suffer you
to die after hearing me speak, but grant you a long
and happy reign. After this, sir, I cannot give you
a greater satisfaction than acquainting you with my
being with child; and I wish, as you do, it may be a
son. Had it never been my fortune to have been
breeding, I was resolved (I beg your majesty to pardon
the sincerity of my intention) never to have loved
you, as well as to have kept an eternal silence; but
now I love and respect you as I ought to do.</p>
<p>The king of Persia, ravished to hear the fair slave
not only speak, but at the same time tell him news
in which he was so nearly concerned, embraced
her tenderly: Shining light of my eyes, said he, it is
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
impossible for me to receive a greater joy than what
you have now given me: you have spoken to me, and
declared your being with child; so that I am fully
satisfied in myself, that after these two signal occasions
of joy, I ought to expect no other.</p>
<p>The king of Persia, in the transport of joy he was
in, said no more to the fair slave. He left her; but
after such a manner as made her perceive his intention
was speedily to return; and being willing that
the occasion of his joy should be made public, he declared
it to his officers, and sent in all haste for the
grand vizier. As soon as he came, he ordered him to
distribute a thousand pieces of gold among the holy
men of his religion, who had made vows of poverty;
as also among the hospitals and the poor, by way of
returning thanks to Heaven; and his will was obeyed,
by the direction of that minister.</p>
<p>After the king of Persia had given this order, he
came to the fair slave again: Madam, said he, pardon
me for leaving you so abruptly, since you have
been the occasion of it; but I hope you will entertain
me some other time, since I am desirous to know of
you several things of a much greater consequence.
However, in the mean time, tell me, I beseech you,
my dearest charmer, what were the powerful reasons
that induced you to persist in that obstinate silence
for a whole year together, though every day you saw
me, heard me talk to you, ate and drank with me,
and every night lay with me? I shall pass by your
not speaking; but how you could carry yourself after
such an indifferent manner, that I could never discover
whether you were sensible of what I said to you,
or no, I must confess it surpasses my understanding:
and I cannot yet comprehend, how you could contain
yourself so long: therefore I must conclude the occasion
of it to be very extraordinary.</p>
<p>To satisfy the king of Persia&rsquo;s curiosity, this fair
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
person replied, Think whether or no to be a slave, far
from my own country, without any hopes of ever seeing
it again, to have a heart torn with grief, for being
separated from my mother, my brother, my friends,
and my acquaintance, are not sufficient reasons for
my keeping a silence your majesty has thought so
strange and unaccountable. The love of our native
country is as natural to us as that of our parents; and
the loss of liberty is unsupportable to every one, who
is not wholly destitute of sense and reason, and knows
how to set a value on it. The body indeed may be
enslaved, and under the subjection of a master who
has the power and authority in his hands; but the
will can never be conquered or domineered over, but
still remains free and unconfined, depending on itself
alone, and your majesty has found an example of it
in me; and it is a wonder that I have not followed
the example of abundance of unfortunate wretches,
whom the loss of liberty has reduced to the mournful
resolution of procuring their own deaths a thousand
ways, rather than survive it, and wear out a wretched
life in shameful slavery.</p>
<p>Madam, replied the king, I am now convinced of
the truth of what you say; but till this moment I was
of opinion, that a person beautiful, well-shaped, with
a great deal of wit and good sense, such as yourself,
whom her rigorous stars had destined to be a slave,
ought to think herself very happy in meeting with a
king for her master.</p>
<p>Sir, replied the fair slave, whatever the slave is,
supposing her to be such as I have already mentioned
to your majesty, there is no king on earth can tyrannize
over her will. But, however, when you speak
of a slave, mistress of charms enough to captivate a
monarch, and make him adore her, provided she is of
a rank infinitely below him, I am of your opinion she
ought to think herself happy in her misfortune; but
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
what happiness can it be when she considers herself
only as a slave, torn from her parents&rsquo; arms, and perhaps
a lover&rsquo;s, for whom she has a passion that death
only can extinguish? But when this very slave is
nothing inferior to the king that bought her, your
majesty shall then judge yourself of the rigour of her
destiny, of her misery, and of her sorrow, and to
what desperate attempts the anguish of despair may
drive her.</p>
<p>The king of Persia, astonished at this discourse,
said, Madam, can it be possible that you are of royal
blood, as by your words you seem to intimate? Explain
the whole secret to me, I beseech you, and no
longer augment my impatience. Ah! let me instantly
know who are the happy parents of so great a prodigy
of beauty, who are your brothers, your sisters,
and your relations; but above all, what your name is.</p>
<p>Sir, said the fair slave, my name is Gulnare of the
sea; and my father, who is now dead, was one of the
most potent monarchs of the ocean. When he died,
he left his kingdom to a brother of mine, named Saleh,
and to the queen my mother, who is also a princess,
the daughter of another puissant monarch of
the sea. We enjoyed a profound peace and tranquillity
through the whole kingdom, till a neighbouring
prince, an enemy to our repose, invaded our dominions
with a mighty army; and, penetrating as far as
our capital, made himself master of it: and we had
but just time enough to save ourselves in a steep
inaccessible place, with a few trusty officers, who
were so generous as not to forsake us in our distress.</p>
<p>In this retreat, my brother was not negligent in
contriving all manner of ways to drive the unjust invader
from our dominions. While this affair was in
agitation, one day taking me into his closet, Sister,
said he, the events of the least undertakings in this
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
world are always dubious. As, for my own part, I
am willing to die in the attempt I design to make to
re-establish myself in my kingdom; and I shall be
less concerned for my own disgrace, than for what may
possibly happen to you; and therefore to prevent it,
and to secure you from whatever accident may befall
you, I would fain see you married first. But in the
miserable condition that our affairs are at present, I
see no probability of matching you to any of the
princes of the sea; and therefore I should be very
glad if you would resolve to be of my opinion, and
think of marrying to some of the princes of the earth.
I am ready to contribute all that lies in my power towards
it, and I am certain there is not one of them,
considering the beauty you are mistress of, but would
be proud of your accepting of their crown.</p>
<p>At this discourse of my brother&rsquo;s, I fell into a violent
passion. Brother, said I, you know that I am
descended, as well as you, by both father and mother&rsquo;s
sides, from the kings and queens of the sea, without
any mixture of alliance with those of the earth;
therefore I do not design to marry below myself, any
more than they did: and I took an oath of it, as soon
as I had understanding to inquire into the nobleness
and antiquity of our family. The condition to which
we are reduced shall never oblige me to alter my resolution;
and if you perish in the execution of your
design, I am prepared to fall with you, rather than
follow the advice I so little expected from you.</p>
<p>My brother, who was still earnest for the marriage,
endeavoured to make me believe that there were
kings of the earth who were no ways inferior to those
of the sea. This put me again into a violent passion,
which occasioned him to speak several bitter reflecting
things that nettled me to the quick. At last he
left me, as much dissatisfied with myself as he could
possibly be; and in this peevish mood, I gave a spring
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
from the bottom of the sea, directly up to the island
of the moon.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the violent discontent that made
me cast myself upon that island, I lived pretty easy
in a by-corner of it, where I retired for conveniency
and safety. But, alas! this happiness lasted not
long; for, in spite of all my endeavours to lie concealed
in my beloved obscurity, a certain person of
distinction and figure, attended by his servants, surprised
me sleeping, and carried me to his own house.
He made violent love to me, and omitted nothing
which he thought might reasonably induce me to
make a return to his passion. When he saw that fair
means would prevail nothing upon me, he attempted
to make use of force; but I soon made him repent of
his insolence. So at last, finding that there was
nothing to be done with me, he resolved to part with
me, which he did to that very merchant who brought
me hither and sold me to your majesty. He was a
very prudent, courteous, obliging person; and during
the whole journey, which was somewhat tedious, he
never gave me the least reason to complain of his
usage.</p>
<p>As for your majesty, sir, continued the princess
Gulnare, if you had not shown me all the respect you
have hitherto paid (for which I am extremely obliged
to your goodness) and given me such undeniable
marks of your affection, that I could no longer doubt
of it; if you had not immediately sent away your
women; give me leave to tell you plainly, sir, that I
was positively resolved not to have lived with you: I
would have thrown myself into the sea, out of this
very window, where your majesty first saw me when
you came into this apartment; and I would have gone
in search after my mother, my brother, and the rest
of my relations. I still persisted in that design, and
I would infallibly have put it in execution, if, after a
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
certain time, I had found myself deceived in the hopes
of being with child: but now, in the condition I am
in, I shall take care what I do. Should I tell my
mother or my brother that I have been a slave, even
to a king as mighty as you are, they would never believe
it, but would for ever upbraid me with the crime
I have committed against my honour, since it was a
voluntary act of my own. However, sir, be it a prince
or a princess that I bring into the world, it will be a
pledge to engage me never to be parted from your
majesty; and therefore I hope you will no longer
look upon me as a slave, but as a princess worthy of
your alliance.</p>
<p>It was after this manner that the princess Gulnare
finished her story she had been telling the king of
Persia. My charming and adorable princess, cried
he, what wonders have I heard! and what an ample
subject have you afforded my curiosity, of asking a
thousand questions concerning those strange and unheard-of
things which you have related to me! But,
in the first place, I ought to thank you for your goodness
and patience in making a trial of the truth and
constancy of my passion. I must confess, I thought
it impossible for me to love you more than I did; but
since I know you to be so great a princess, I love you
a thousand times more. What! did I say princess?
Madam, you are no longer so; but you are my queen,
the queen of Persia; and by that title you shall soon
be proclaimed throughout the whole kingdom. Tomorrow
the ceremony shall be performed in my capital,
with a pomp and magnificence that was never
yet beheld; which will plainly show, that you are
both my queen and lawful wife. This should have
been done long ago, had you sooner convinced me of
my error; for, from the first moment of my seeing
you, I have been of the same opinion as now, to love
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
you for ever, and never to place my affection on any
other.</p>
<p>However, I am pleased with myself for having, in
the mean time, paid you all the respect and civility I
ought, that is due to your merit; and therefore, madam,
I beseech you to inform me in a more particular
manner, of the kingdoms and people of the sea, which
are altogether unknown to me. I have heard much
talk indeed of the inhabitants of the sea; but I always
looked upon it as nothing but a pleasant tale or
fable: however, by what you have told me, I am convinced
there is nothing more true; and I have a very
good proof of it in your own person, who are one of
them, and are pleased to condescend to be my wife;
which is an honour no other inhabitant on the earth
can boast of besides myself. There is one thing yet,
madam, which puzzles me a little, therefore I must
beg the favour of you to explain it; that is, I cannot
comprehend how it is possible for you to move,
breathe, and walk up and down in the water, without
being drowned. There are but few amongst us
who have the art of staying under water; but they
would surely perish there, if after a certain space of
time, which is according to their skill, and constitution
of their bodies, they did not come up again.</p>
<p>Sir, replied the queen Gulnare, I shall take a great
deal of pleasure in satisfying the king of Persia in
any thing that lies in my power. You must know,
then, that we can walk at the bottom of the sea with
as much ease as you can upon the dry land; and can
breathe in the water as well as you do in the air; so
that instead of suffocating us, as it does you, it is
absolutely necessary for the preservation of our lives.
What is yet more remarkable is, that it never wets
our clothes: so that when we have a mind to visit
your upper world, we have no occasion of drying
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
them. Our vulgar language is the same in which the
writing upon the seal of the great prophet Solomon,
the son of David, was engraven.</p>
<p>I must not forget to tell you, that the water does
not in the least hinder us from seeing in the sea; for
we can open and shut our eyes when we please, without
any manner of inconveniency; and as we have
generally a very quick, piercing sight, so we can discern
any object as clearly in the deepest part of the
sea, as upon land. We have also a succession there
of day and night; the moon affords us her light, and
even the planets and the stars appear very visible to
us. I have already spoken of their kingdoms; but as
the sea is a great deal larger than the earth, so there
are a greater number of them, and of vaster extent.
They are divided into provinces, and in every province
there are several great cities, well peopled;
and, in short, there are an infinite number of nations,
differing in manners and customs, as well as upon
the earth.</p>
<p>The palaces of the kings and princes are very
sumptuous and magnificent. There are some of them
of marble of various colours; others of rock-crystal,
mother-of-pearl, coral, and of other materials more
valuable; gold, silver, and all sorts of precious stones,
are more plentiful there than with you. I say nothing
of the pearls, since the largest that ever was seen
upon the earth would not be valuable amongst us;
and none but the very lowest rank of citizens would
wear them.</p>
<p>As we have a marvellous and almost incredible
agility of transporting ourselves whither we please in
the twinkling of an eye, so we have no occasion for
any coaches or horses: not but that every king has
his stables, and his breed of sea-horses; but they seldom
make use of them, but upon public feasts and
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
rejoicing days. After they have been well managed,
they set riders upon their backs, who show their skill
and dexterity in the art of riding: others are put to
chariots of mother-of-pearl, adorned with an infinite
number of shells of all sorts, of the liveliest colours
in the world. These chariots are open; and in the
middle there is a throne on which the king sits, and
exposes himself to the public view of his subjects.
The horses are trained up to draw by themselves, so
that there is no occasion for a coachman to guide
them. I pass over a thousand other particulars relating
to these sea-countries, full of wonder and
curiosity, which would be very entertaining to your
majesty; but I believe, sir, you will be pleased I
should defer it, to speak of something of much greater
consequence; which is, that the method of delivering,
and the way of managing the women of the sea in
their lying-in, is quite different from those of the women
of the earth; and I am afraid to trust myself in
the hands of the midwives of this country. Therefore,
sir, since my safe delivery is a thing which equally
concerns us both, with your majesty&rsquo;s permission, I
think it proper to send for my mother and my cousins
to assist at my labour; at the same time to desire my
brother&rsquo;s company, to whom I have a great desire to
be reconciled. They will be very glad to see me
again, after I have related my story to them, and
when they understand that I am wife to the mighty
king of Persia. I beseech your majesty to give me
leave to send for them: I am sure they will be proud
to pay their respects to you; and I dare say you will
be extremely pleased to see them.</p>
<p>Madam, said the king of Persia, you are mistress,
and so do whatever you please; I will endeavour to
receive them with all the honours they deserve. But
I would fain know how you would acquaint them with
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
what you desire, and when they will arrive; that I
may make some preparation for their reception, and
go myself in person to meet them.</p>
<p>Sir, replied the queen Gulnare, there is no need of
any of these ceremonies; they will be here in a moment:
and if your majesty will be pleased but to step
into the closet and look through the lattice, you shall
see the manner of their arrival.</p>
<p>As soon as the king of Persia was gone into the
closet, the queen Gulnare ordered one of her women
to bring her a perfuming-pan, with a little fire in it.
After that, she bade her retire, and shut the door.
When she was alone, she took a little piece of aloes
out of a box, and put it into the perfuming-pan. As
soon as she saw the smoke arise, she repeated some
mystical words, utterly unknown to the king of Persia,
who observed with great attention what she was
doing. She had no sooner ended her charm, than the
sea began to be disturbed. The closet that the king
was in was so contrived, that looking through the
lattice, on the same side with the windows that faced
the sea, he could plainly perceive it.</p>
<p>In short, the sea opened at some distance; presently
there appeared a tall handsome young man,
with whiskers of a sea-green colour; a little behind
him, a lady well in years, but of a stately majestic
air, attended by five young ladies, nothing inferior in
beauty to queen Gulnare.</p>
<p>The queen Gulnare immediately came to one of the
windows, and saw the king her brother, the queen her
mother, and the rest of her relations, who at the same
time perceived her also. The company came forward,
not walking, but carried, as it were, upon the surface
of the waves. When they came to the brink of the
sea, they nimbly, one after another, leaped in at the
window, from whence the queen Gulnare was retired,
to make room for them. The king Saleh, the queen
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
her mother, and the rest of her relations, embraced
her tenderly, with tears in their eyes, upon their first
entrance.</p>
<p>After the queen Gulnare had received them with all
the honour imaginable, and placed them upon a sofa,
the queen her mother addressed herself to her after a
very tender manner. Daughter, said she, I am overjoyed
to see you again, after so long an absence; and
I am confident that your brother and your relations
are no less so than I. Your leaving us, without acquainting
any body with it, put us into an inexpressible
concern; and it is impossible to tell you how
many tears we have shed upon that account. We know
of no other reason that could induce you to take such
a surprising resolution, but the discourse that passed
between your brother and you, of which he afterwards
informed me. The advice he gave you seemed very
advantageous to him at that time, for settling you
handsomely in the world; and was then very suitable
to the posture of our affairs. However, if you had
not approved of his proposals, you ought not to have
been so much alarmed; and give me leave to tell you,
you took the thing quite otherwise than you ought
to have done. But no more of this discourse, which
serves only to renew the occasion of our sorrows and
complaints, that we and you ought to bury for ever in
oblivion. Give us now a relation of all that has happened
to you since you left us, and also an account of
the present circumstances you are in; but especially
let us know if you are pleased and contented.</p>
<p>The queen Gulnare immediately threw herself at
her mother&rsquo;s feet, and after rising up and kissing her
hand, said, Madam, I own I have been guilty of a very
great crime, and I shall be indebted to your goodness
for the pardon which I hope you will be pleased to
grant me. What I am going to say, in obedience to
your commands, will soon convince you, that it is very
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
often in vain for us to have an aversion for some certain
things: I have experienced it myself; and the
only thing I had an abhorrence to, either justly, or by
the malice of my stars, has happened to me here. She
began to relate the whole story of what had befallen
her since her quitting the sea, in a violent passion, for
the earth. As soon as she had made an end, and had
acquainted them with her having been sold to the king
of Persia, in whose palace she was at present; Sister,
cried the king her brother, you have been mightily
wronged in having so many affronts offered you; but
you can blame nobody but yourself: you have it in
your power now to free yourself; and I cannot but
admire your patience, that you could endure so long
a slavery. Rise, and return with us into my kingdom,
that I have reconquered, and taken from the proud
usurper that was once master of it.</p>
<p>The king of Persia, who heard these killing words
from the closet where he stood, was in the utmost
confusion imaginable. Ah! said he to himself, I am
ruined and undone; and if my queen, my angel, leaves
me, I shall surely die, for it is impossible for me to
live without her: and will they be so barbarous as to
deprive me of her? But the queen Gulnare soon put
him out of his fears, and eased the sorrow of his
heart.</p>
<p>Brother, said she, and smiled, what I have just
now heard, gives me a greater proof than ever I had
of the sincerity of your friendship for me; but as
heretofore I could not brook your proposing a match
between me and a prince of the earth, so now I can
scarce forbear being angry with you, for advising me
to break the engagement I have made with the most
puissant and most renowned monarch in the world. I
do not speak here of an engagement between a slave
and her master; if that were all, it would be easy to
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
return the ten thousand pieces of gold that I cost him;
but I speak now of a contract between a woman and
her husband, who has never given her the least reason
to complain or be discontented: besides, he is a king,
wise, temperate, religious, and just, and has given me
the most essential demonstrations of his love that possibly
he could. What can be a greater instance of
the violence of his passion, than sending away all his
women (of which he had a great number) immediately
upon my arrival, and confining himself only to me?
I am now his wife, and he has lately declared me
queen of Persia; and I am to sit with him in the
council: besides, I am breeding; and if Heaven shall
be pleased to favour me with a son, that shall be another
motive to engage my affections to him the more.
So, brother, continued the queen Gulnare, instead
of following your advice, you see I have all the reason
in the world, not only to love the king of Persia as
passionately as I do, but also to live and die with him,
more out of gratitude than duty. I hope, then, neither
my mother, nor you, nor any of my cousins, will
disapprove of the resolution and alliance I have made,
which will be an equal honour to the kings of both the
sea and earth. I ask a thousand pardons for giving
you the trouble of coming hither from the bottom of
the deep to partake of it; and I return you thanks for
the pleasure of seeing you after so long a separation.</p>
<p>Sister, replied king Saleh, the proposition I made
you of going back with us into my kingdom, upon the
recital of your adventures, (which I could not hear
without concern,) was to let you see what a particular
love and honour I had for you, and that nothing in the
world was so dear to me as your welfare and happiness.
Upon the same account, then, for my own part,
I cannot condemn a resolution so reasonable, and so
worthy of yourself, after what you have told me of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
king of Persia your husband, and the many obligations
you have to him; and I am persuaded that the
queen our mother will be of the same opinion.</p>
<p>The queen confirmed what her son had just spoken,
and addressing herself immediately to her daughter,
said, My dear, I am very glad to hear you are pleased;
and I have nothing else to add to what your brother
has already said to you. I should have been the first
that would have condemned you, if you had not expressed
all the gratitude you were capable of for a
monarch that loves you so passionately, and has done
such mighty things to oblige you.</p>
<p>As the king of Persia, who was still in the closet,
had been extremely concerned for fear of losing his
beloved queen, so now he was transported with joy at
her resolution never to forsake him; and having no
room to doubt of her love, after so open a declaration,
he began to love her more than ever, and was resolved
within himself to give her all the outward proofs of
it, after the most sensible manner he possibly could.</p>
<p>While the king was entertaining himself with a
pleasure that cannot easily be imagined, the queen
Gulnare clapped her hands aloud, and presently in
came some of her slaves, whom she had ordered to
bring in a collation. As soon as it was served up,
she invited the queen her mother, the king her brother,
and her cousins, to sit down and take part of
it. They began to consider, that, without ever asking
leave, they were got into the palace of a mighty king,
who had never seen or heard of them, and were all of
the same opinion, that it would be a great piece of
rudeness and incivility to eat at his table without him.
This reflection raised a blush in their faces, and their
eyes glowing with the concern they were in, they
breathed nothing but flames at their mouths and
nostrils.</p>
<p>This unexpected sight put the king of Persia, who
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
was perfectly ignorant of the cause of it, into a most
dreadful consternation. The queen Gulnare fancying
that his majesty might be a little surprised at it, and
finding her relations desirous of the honour of seeing
him, rose from her seat, and told them she would be
back in a moment. She went directly to the closet,
and by her presence recovered the king of Persia from
his surprise: Sir, said she, I doubt not but that your
majesty is well pleased with the acknowledgment I
have lately made of the many favours that I am still
indebted to your goodness for. It was wholly in my
power to have complied with my relations, who would
fain have persuaded me to have forsaken you, and
gone back with them into their dominions; but alas!
I am not capable of being guilty of such ingratitude as
I should have condemned in another. Ah! my queen,
cried the king of Persia, speak no more of your obligations
to me, for indeed you have none; it is I that
am your debtor so much, that I am afraid I shall never
be able to repay, or return you thanks equal to the
favour you have done me; for I never thought it possible
you could have loved me so tenderly as you do,
and as you have made it appear to me, after the most
signal manner in the world. Ah! sir, replied the
queen Gulnare, could I do less than I have done? I
rather fear I have not done enough, considering all
the honours and favours that your majesty has heaped
upon me; and it is impossible for me to remain insensible
of your passion, after so many convincing
proofs as you have given me. But let us drop this,
and give me leave to assure you of the sincere friendship
that the queen my mother, and the king my brother,
are pleased to honour you with; they earnestly
desire to see you, and tell you themselves. I intended
to have discoursed with them a little before I introduced
them to your majesty, and accordingly I have
ordered a banquet for them; but they are very impatient
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
to pay their respects to you, and therefore I
desire your majesty would be pleased to walk in, and
honour them with your presence.</p>
<p>Madam, said the king of Persia, I should be very
glad to salute persons that have the honour to be so
nearly related to you; but I am afraid of the flames
that they breathe at their mouths and nostrils. Sir,
replied the queen, laughing, you need not in the least
be afraid of those flames, which are nothing but a sign
of their unwillingness to eat in your palace without
your honouring them with your presence, and eating
with them.</p>
<p>The king of Persia taking heart at these words,
went into his chamber with his queen Gulnare. She
presented him to the queen her mother, to the king
her brother, and to her other relations, who instantly
threw themselves at his feet, with their faces to the
ground. The king of Persia ran to them, and lifting
them up, embraced them one after another after a very
tender manner. After they were all seated, king
Saleh began his speech: Sir, said he to the king of
Persia, we are at a loss for words to express our joy,
to think that the queen my sister, after all her hardships
and affronts, should have the happiness of falling
under the protection of so powerful a monarch as
your majesty. We can assure you, sir, she is not unworthy
of the high honour that you have been pleased
to raise her to; and we have always had so much love
and tenderness for her, that we could never think of
parting with her, even to the most puissant princes
of the sea, who have often demanded her in marriage
before she came of age: but Heaven has reserved her
for you, sir; and we have no better way of returning
thanks for the favour it has done her, than beseeching
it to grant your majesty a long and happy life with
her, and to crown your days with content and satisfaction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>Certainly, replied the king of Persia, Heaven reserved
her purely for me, as you were pleased to observe;
and I love her with so tender and violent a
passion, that it is plain I never loved any woman till
I saw her. Oh! how I am blessed and transported
with her charms! and I cannot sufficiently thank
either the queen her mother, or you, prince, or your
whole family, for the matchless generosity with which
you have consented to receive me into so glorious an
alliance as yours. At the end of these words, he invited
them to take part of the collation, and he and
his queen sat down at his table with them. After the
collation was over, the king of Persia entertained
them with discourse till it was very late; and when
they thought it convenient to retire, he waited upon
them himself to the several apartments he had ordered
to be prepared for them.</p>
<p>The king of Persia treated his illustrious guests for
a great many days together; during which time, he
omitted nothing that might show his court in its greatest
splendour and magnificence, and insensibly prevailed
with them to stay there till the queen was
brought to bed. When the time of her lying-in drew
near, he gave particular orders to get every thing in
readiness that was necessary upon such an occasion.
At last there was a son born, to the great joy of the
queen his mother, who, as soon as he was dressed in
swaddling-clothes, which were very rich and costly,
went and presented him to the king.</p>
<p>The king of Persia received the present with a joy
easier to be imagined than expressed. The young
prince being of a beautiful countenance, and all over
charms, he thought no name so proper for him as that
of Beder, which, in the Arabian language, signifies
the Full Moon. By way of thanks to Heaven, he was
very liberal in his alms to the poor, and caused the
prison-doors to be set open, and gave all the prisoners
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
of both sexes their liberty. He distributed vast
sums among the priests and the holy men of his religion.
He also gave large donatives to his courtiers,
besides a great deal that was thrown amongst the people;
and, by a proclamation, ordered several rejoicing
days to be kept publicly through the whole city.</p>
<p>One day after the queen&rsquo;s up-sitting, as the king of
Persia, queen Gulnare herself, the queen her mother,
king Saleh her brother, and the princesses their relations,
were discoursing together in her majesty&rsquo;s bed-chamber,
the nurse chanced to come in with the young
prince Beder in her arms. King Saleh no sooner saw
him, than he ran to embrace him, and taking him in
his arms, fell a kissing and caressing him after a
mighty rate. He took several turns with him about
the room, dancing and dandling him about, when all
of a sudden, through a transport of joy, the window
being open, he leaped out, and plunged with him into
the sea.</p>
<p>The king of Persia, who expected no such sight,
set up a hideous cry, verily believing he should either
see the dear prince his son no more, or that he should
see him drowned; nay, he was like to give up the
ghost amidst his so great grief and affliction. Sir,
quoth queen Gulnare, with a quiet and undisturbed
countenance, (the better to comfort him,) let your
majesty fear nothing; the young prince is my son as
well as yours, and I do not love him less than you do.
You see I am not alarmed at the loss of him; neither
in truth ought I to be so. In short, he runs no risk,
and you will soon see the king his uncle appear with
him again, who will return him to you safe and sound.
Although he be born of your blood as well as mine,
he will not fail to have the same advantage his uncle
and I have, of living equally in the sea and upon the
land. The queen his mother, and the princesses his
relations, confirmed the same thing: yet all was no
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
great consolation to the king; he could not possibly
recover from his fright till he saw prince Beder appear
again as before.</p>
<p>The sea at length became troubled, when immediately
king Saleh arose, with the young prince in his
arms, and dancing and dandling him about, re-entered
at the same window he went out at. The king of
Persia, overjoyed to see prince Beder again, became
as calm as before he lost sight of him. Then king
Saleh said, Sir, was not your majesty in a great fright,
when you first saw me plunge into the sea with the
prince my nephew? Alas! prince, answered the king
of Persia, I cannot express my concern: I thought him
lost from that very moment, and you now restore life
to me by bringing him again. I thought as much, replied
king Saleh, though you had not the least reason
to apprehend any danger; for before I plunged into
the sea with him, I pronounced certain mysterious
words over him, which were engraven on the seal of
the great Solomon the Son of David. We practise
the like in relation to all those children that are born
in the regions at the bottom of the sea, by virtue
whereof they receive the same privileges that we
have over those people who inhabit the earth. Now,
from what your majesty has observed, you may easily
see what advantage your son prince Beder has acquired
on the part of his mother queen Gulnare my
sister; for as long as he lives, and as often as he
pleases, it shall be free for him to plunge into the sea,
and traverse the vast empires it contains at its
bottom.</p>
<p>Having so spoken, king Saleh, who had restored
prince Beder to his nurse&rsquo;s arms, opened a box he had
fetched from his palace in that little time he had disappeared,
which was filled with three hundred diamonds,
as large as pigeons&rsquo; eggs; a like number of
rubies, of extraordinary size; as many emerald wands,
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
of half a foot long; and with thirty strings of necklaces
of pearl, consisting each of ten pieces. Sir, said
he to the king of Persia, presenting him with this box,
when I was first summoned by the queen my sister, I
knew not what part of the earth she was in, or that
she had the honour to be married to so great a monarch
as I now find; wherefore I came empty-handed: but
now I understand how much we have been both obliged
to your majesty, I beg you therefore to accept of
this small token of gratitude, in acknowledgment of
the many particular favours you have been pleased to
do us, and whereof I am not less sensible than she.</p>
<p>It cannot be imagined how greatly the king of Persia
was surprised at the sight of so much riches enclosed
in so little compass. What! prince, cried he,
do you call so inestimable a present a small token of
your gratitude, when you never have been indebted
to me? I declare you have never been in the least
obliged to me, neither you nor the queen your mother;
I esteem myself but too happy in the consent you have
been pleased to give to the alliance I have contracted
with you. Madam, continued he, turning to Gulnare,
the king your brother has put me into the greatest
confusion in the world; and I would beg of him to retain
his present, were it not that I fear to disoblige
him. Do you therefore endeavour to obtain his leave,
that I may be dispensed with on this occasion.</p>
<p>Sir, replied king Saleh, I am not at all surprised
that your majesty thinks this present so extraordinary:
I know you are not accustomed upon earth to see such
and so many fine stones; but if you knew, as I do,
the mines from whence these jewels were taken, and
that it is in my power to heap up a treasure, much
larger than those, of all the things of the earth, you
would, it may be, wonder I should have the boldness
to make you a present of so small a value. I beseech
you therefore not to regard it in that respect, but on
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
account of the sincere friendship I am obliged to offer
to you, which I hope you will not give me the mortification
to refuse. These engaging expressions obliged
the king of Persia to accept the present, for which
he returned many thanks, both to king Saleh and the
queen his mother.</p>
<p>A few days after, king Saleh gave the king of Persia
to understand that the queen his mother, the princesses
his relations, and himself could have no greater
pleasure than to spend their whole lives at his court;
but that having been absent from their own kingdom
for some time, where their presence was absolutely
necessary, they begged of him not to take it ill, if
they took leave of him and queen Gulnare. The king
of Persia assured them he was very sorry that it was
not in his power to come and visit them in their dominions;
but added, As I am verily persuaded you
will not forget queen Gulnare, but come and see her
now and then, I hope I shall have the honour to kiss
your hands again many times before I die.</p>
<p>Many tears were shed on both sides upon their separation.
King Saleh departed first; but the queen
his mother, and the princesses his relations, were fain
to force themselves, in a manner, from the embraces
of queen Gulnare, who could not prevail with herself
to let them go. This royal company were no sooner
out of sight, than the king of Persia said to queen Gulnare,
Madam, I should have looked upon that person
as one who would have imposed on my credulity in
the grossest manner, that had pretended to palm those
wonders upon me for true, which I myself have been
an eye-witness of from the time I have been honoured
with your illustrious family at my court: but I cannot
escape conviction of this kind; and shall remember
it as long as I live, and be always ready to bless
Heaven for directing you to me, rather than to any
other prince.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>Young prince Beder was brought up and educated
in the palace, under the care of the king and queen of
Persia, who both saw him grow and increase in beauty,
to their great satisfaction. He gave them yet greater
pleasure as he advanced in years, by his continued
sprightliness, by his agreeable ways in whatever he
did, and by the justness and vivacity of his wit in
whatever he said; and they were the more sensible
of this satisfaction, by reason king Saleh his uncle,
the queen his grandmother, and the princesses his
relations, came from time to time to take part of it.</p>
<p>He was easily taught to read and write, and was
instructed with the same facility in all the sciences
that became a prince of his rank.</p>
<p>When he arrived at fifteen, he acquitted himself of
all his exercises with infinitely better address, and
good grace, than any of his masters. He was withal
very wise and prudent. The king, who had almost
from his cradle discovered in him virtues so necessary
for a monarch, and who moreover began to perceive
the infirmities of old age coming upon himself, would
not stay till death gave him the possession of his throne,
but purposed to resign it to him immediately. He
had no great difficulty to make his council consent to
it; and the people heard this resolution with so much
the more joy, as they conceived prince Beder worthy
to govern them. In a word, as the king had not for
a long time appeared in public, they had all the opportunity
in the world to observe he had not that disdainful,
proud, and crabbed air, which most princes,
who look upon all below them with scorn and contempt,
have. They saw, on the contrary, he treated
all mankind with that goodness which invited them to
approach him, that he heard favourably all who had
any thing to say to him; that he answered every body
with a goodness that was peculiar to him; and that
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
he refused nobody any thing that had the least appearance
of reasonableness.</p>
<p>The day for the ceremony was appointed, when in
the midst of the whole assembly, which was then
more numerous than ordinary, the king of Persia,
then sitting on his throne, came down from it, took
the crown off his head, put it on that of prince Beder;
and having seated him in his place, kissed his
hand, as a token that he resigned his authority to
him: after which, he ranged himself among the
crowd of viziers and emirs.</p>
<p>Hereupon the viziers, emirs, and other principal
officers, came immediately and threw themselves at
the new king&rsquo;s feet, taking each the oath of fidelity,
according to their degrees. Then the grand vizier
made a report of divers important matters; on
which the young king gave judgment with that admirable
prudence and sagacity that surprised all the
council. He next turned out divers governors convicted
of mal-administration, and put others in their
room; which he did with that wonderful and just
discernment as excited the acclamations of every body,
which were so much the more honourable, as flattery
had no share in them. He at length left the council,
accompanied by the late king his father, and went to
wait on his mother queen Gulnare, at her apartment.
The queen no sooner saw him coming with the crown
upon his head, than she ran to embrace him with a
great deal of tenderness, wishing him a long and
prosperous reign.</p>
<p>The first year of his reign, king Beder acquitted
himself of all his royal functions with great assiduity.
Above all, he took care to instruct himself
in affairs of state, and all that might any way contribute
towards the happiness of his people. Next
year, having left the administration to his council,
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
under the direction of the old king his father, he
went out of his capital city, under pretence of diverting
himself with hunting; but his real intention
was to visit all the provinces of his kingdom, that he
might reform all abuses there, establish good order
and discipline every where, and deprive all ill-minded
princes, his neighbours, of any opportunities of attempting
any thing against the security and tranquillity
of his subjects, by appearing and showing himself
seasonably on his frontiers.</p>
<p>No less than a whole year sufficed this young king
to put in practice a purpose so worthy of him. Soon
after his return, the old king his father fell so dangerously
ill, that he knew at first he should never
recover. He waited for his last moment with great
tranquillity, and his only care was to recommend to
the ministers and other lords of his son&rsquo;s court to
persist in the fidelity they had sworn to him; insomuch
that there was not one but willingly renewed
his oath as freely as at first. He died at length, to
the great grief of king Beder and queen Gulnare,
who caused his corpse to be carried to a stately mausoleum,
worthy of his rank and dignity.</p>
<p>When the funeral obsequies were ended, king
Beder found no difficulty to comply with that ancient
custom in Persia to mourn for the dead a whole
month, and not to be seen by any body during all that
time. He had mourned the death of his father his
whole life, had he hearkened to his excessive affliction,
and had it been permitted to so great a prince
as he was to amuse himself after that manner. During
this interval, the queen, mother to queen Gulnare,
and king Saleh, together with the princesses
their relations, arrived at the Persian court, and
shared in great part of their affliction, before they
proposed any consolation.</p>
<p>Though the month was expired, the king could
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
not prevail on himself to give admittance to the
grand vizier and the other lords of his court, who all
besought him to lay aside his mourning habit, to
show himself to his subjects, and take upon him the
administration of affairs as before.</p>
<p>He showed so great unwillingness to their request,
that the grand vizier took upon him to speak
in the following manner: Sir, it would be needless
to represent to your majesty that it belongs only to
women to persist in perpetual mourning. We doubt
not but you are sufficiently convinced of that, and
that it is not your intention to follow their example.
Neither our tears nor yours are capable of restoring
life to the good king your father, though we should
lament all our days. He has undergone the common
fate of all men, which nobody can resist. Yet
we cannot say absolutely that he is dead, since we
see him reviving in the person of your sacred majesty.
He did not himself doubt, when he was dying,
but he should revive in you, and to your majesty
it belongs to show that he was not deceived.</p>
<p>King Beder could no longer oppose such pressing
instances. He laid aside his mourning habit that
very moment; and after he had resumed the royal
ornaments, he began to provide for the necessities of
his subjects with the same assiduity as before his
father&rsquo;s death. He acquitted himself with universal
approbation; and, as he was exact in maintaining his
predecessor&rsquo;s ordinances, the people perceived no alteration
in their sovereign.</p>
<p>King Saleh, who was returned to his dominions in
the sea, with the queen his mother and the princesses,
no sooner saw that king Beder had resumed
the government, than he came alone to visit him; and
king Beder and queen Gulnare were overjoyed to
see him. One day, as they rose from table, they
fell to discoursing of several matters. King Saleh
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
fell insensibly on the praises of the king his nephew,
and the queen his sister, how glad he was to see
him govern so prudently, which had acquired him
so great reputation, not only among his neighbours,
but more remote princes. King Beder, who could
not bear to hear himself so well spoken of, and not
being willing to interrupt the king his uncle, through
good manners turned on one side, and seemed to be
asleep, leaning his head against a cushion that was
behind him.</p>
<p>From these commendations, which regarded only
the wonderful conduct and surprising wit of king
Beder, king Saleh came to speak of the perfections
of his body, which he extolled after a mighty rate,
as having nothing equal to them, either upon the
earth, or the kingdoms under the waters, which he
was well acquainted with.</p>
<p>Sister, said he in an ecstasy, so beautiful as he is,
and of such excellent endowments, I wonder you
have not thought of marrying him ere this: if I mistake
not, he is at present in his twentieth year,
and at that age no prince ought to be suffered to be
without a wife. I will think of a match for him myself,
since you will not, and marry him to some
princess of our lower world, that may be worthy of
him.</p>
<p>Brother, replied queen Gulnare, you call to my
remembrance a thing, I must own, I have never
thought of to this very moment. As he never discovered
any inclination for marriage, I never thought
of mentioning it to him; and I am glad you have
now spoken of it to me. I like your proposing one of
your princesses; and I desire you to name one who
may be beautiful and well accomplished, that the
king my son may be obliged to love her.</p>
<p>I know one that will be proper, replied king Saleh,
softly; but before I will tell you who she is, let
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
us see if the king my nephew sleeps or not, and I will
tell you afterwards why it is necessary we should
take that precaution. Queen Gulnare then looked
upon her son, and thought she had no reason to
doubt but he was profoundly asleep, (king Beder
nevertheless, very far from sleeping, redoubled his
attention, as being unwilling to lose any thing the
king his uncle said upon that subject.) There is no
necessity for your speaking so low, said the queen to
the king her brother; you may speak out with all
freedom, without fear of being heard.</p>
<p>It is by no means proper, replied king Saleh, that
the king my nephew should as yet have any knowledge
of what I am going to say. Love, you know,
sometimes enters the ear; and it is not necessary he
should love this lady I am about to name, after that
sort: in short, I see many difficulties to surmount in
this case, not on the lady&rsquo;s part, as I hope, but on
that of her father. I need only mention to you the
princess Giahaure<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a>,
and the king of Samarcand.</p>
<p>How, brother, replied queen Gulnare, is not the
princess Giahaure yet married? I remember to have
seen her a little before I left your palace; she was
then about eighteen months old, and surprisingly
beautiful, and must needs be the wonder of the
world, if her charms have increased equal with her
years. The few years she is older than the king my
son, ought not to hinder our doing our utmost to
bring the match about. Let me know but the difficulties
that are to be surmounted, and I will warrant
we will do well enough.</p>
<p>Sister, replied king Saleh, the greatest difficulty
is, that the king of Samarcand is insupportably vain,
looking upon all others as his inferiors: it is not
likely we shall easily get him to enter into this alliance.
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
For my part, I will go to him in person, and
demand the princess his daughter of him; and in
case he refuses her, will address ourselves elsewhere,
where we shall be like to be more favourably heard.
For this reason, as you may perceive, added he, it is
not proper for the king my nephew to know any
thing of our design, lest he should fall in love with
the princess Giahaure, and we afterwards not be able
to obtain her for him. They discoursed a little longer
upon this point, and before they parted, agreed that
king Saleh should forthwith return to his own dominions,
and demand the princess Giahaure of the
king of Samarcand, her father, for the king of Persia,
his nephew.</p>
<p>This done, queen Gulnare and king Saleh, who
verily believed king Beder asleep, agreed to wake
him; and he dissembled the matter so well, that he
seemed to wake from a profound sleep. He had
nevertheless heard every word they said; and the
character they gave of the princess Giahaure had
inflamed his heart with an unknown passion. He
had conceived so bright an idea of her beauty, that
he could not sleep a wink all night, but remained
under continual inquietudes.</p>
<p>Next day king Saleh would needs take leave of
queen Gulnare and the king his nephew. The
young king, who knew the king his uncle would not
have departed so soon, but to go and promote his
happiness, blushed when he heard him mention his
departure. His passion was become so violent, it
would not suffer him to wait so long for the sight of
his mistress as would suffice to accomplish the marriage.
He more than once resolved to desire his
uncle to bring her away with him; but as he did not
care to let the queen his mother understand he knew
any thing of what had passed, he desired him only
to stay with him a day or two, that they might hunt
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
together, intending to make use of that occasion to
discover his mind to him.</p>
<p>The day for hunting was set, and king Beder had
many opportunities to declare his mind to his uncle;
but he had not the courage so much as once to
open his mouth to acquaint him with what he designed.</p>
<p>In the midst of the chase, when not only king Saleh
but all his attendants had left him, he alighted
near a spring; and, having tied his horse to a tree
that afforded a very plentiful shade, as did several
others along the banks of the rivulet, he laid himself
down on the grass, and gave a free course to his
tears, which issued forth in great abundance, accompanied
with many sobs and sighs. He remained in
this condition, overwhelmed with thought, and not
speaking so much as one word. King Saleh, in the
mean time, missing the king his nephew, and not
meeting with any one who could tell tidings of him,
began to be much concerned to know what was become
of him. He therefore left his company to go
in search of him, and at length perceived him at a
distance. He had observed the day before, and even
more evidently that day, that he was not so merry
as he used to be, that he was more pensive than
ordinary, and that if he was asked a question, he
either answered not at all, or nothing to the purpose:
but he never so much as in the least suspected
the cause of all this alteration, till he saw him lying
in that disconsolate posture; when he immediately
guessed he had not only heard what passed between
him and the queen Gulnare, but was become passionately
in love. He hereupon alighted, at some
distance from him, and having tied his horse to a
tree, took a compass, and came upon him so softly,
that he heard him pronounce the following
words:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>Adorable princess of the kingdom of Samarcand,
cried he out, I have no doubt had but an imperfect
sketch of your incomparable beauty; yet I hold you
to be preferable to all the princesses in the world in
charms, and to excel them as much as the sun does
the moon and stars. I would this moment go and
offer you my heart, if I but knew where to find you:
it belongs to you, dear princess, and nobody shall be
the possessor of it but you.</p>
<p>King Saleh would hear no more: he advanced
immediately, and discovered himself to king Beder.
From what I have understood, nephew, said he, you
heard that which the queen your mother and I discoursed
the other day of the princess Giahaure. It
was not our intention you should have known any
thing, and we verily thought you were asleep. My
dear uncle, replied king Beder, I heard every word
you said, and have sufficiently experienced the effect
you foretold; which it was not in your power to prevent.
I detained you on purpose to acquaint you
with my love before your departure; but the confusion
I had to let you know my weakness, if it be any
to love so worthy a princess as this seems to be, altogether
sealed my mouth. I beseech you then, by
the friendship you profess for a prince that has the
honour to be so nearly allied to you, that you would
pity me, and not delay to procure me the consent of
the king of Samarcand, that I may marry his daughter,
the adorable Giahaure, with all speed, unless you
have a mind to see me die with love before I have
the sight of her.</p>
<p>These words of the king of Persia troubled king
Saleh very much: he gave him to understand how
difficult it was to give him the satisfaction he desired,
and that he could not well do it without carrying
him along with him; which might be of dangerous
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
consequences, since his presence was so absolutely
necessary in his kingdom, that the least absence
might occasion his subjects to revolt. He conjured
him, therefore, to moderate his passion till such time
as he had put things into a better posture; assuring
him he would use his utmost diligence to content
him, and, when he had brought matters to bear, he
would come to acquaint him. But these reasons
were not sufficient to satisfy the king of Persia.
Cruel uncle, said he, I find you do not love me so
much as you pretended, and that you had rather see
me die than grant the first request that ever I made
you.</p>
<p>I am ready to convince your majesty, replied king
Saleh, that I would do any thing to serve you in reason;
but as for carrying you along with me, I cannot
do that till I have spoken to the queen your mother.
What would she say if I should do this? If
she consents, I am ready to do all you would have
me. You cannot be ignorant, replied the king of
Persia, that the queen my mother would never willingly
part with me; and therefore this excuse of
yours does but yet farther convince me of the hardness
of your heart. If you do really love me, as you
would have me to believe you do, you must return to
your kingdom immediately, and carry me along with
you.</p>
<p>King Saleh, finding himself in a manner obliged to
yield to his nephew&rsquo;s importunity, drew a ring off
his finger, which was engraved with the same mysterious
names of God that were upon Solomon&rsquo;s
seal, that had wrought so many wonders by their
virtue. Here, take this ring, said he, put it upon
your finger, and fear neither the waters of the sea,
nor their depth. The king of Persia took the ring,
and when he had put it on his finger, king Saleh said
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
unto him, Follow me; when, at the same time, they
both mounted leisurely up into the air, and made towards
the sea, which was not far off, whereinto they
jointly plunged.</p>
<p>The sea-king was not long in going to his palace
with the king of Persia, whom he immediately carried
to the queen&rsquo;s apartment, and presented him to
her. The king of Persia kissed the queen his grandmother&rsquo;s
hands, and she embraced him with great
demonstrations of joy. I do not ask you how you
do, said she to him, I see you are well enough, and I
am rejoiced at it; but I desire to know how my
daughter and your mother queen Gulnare does.
The king of Persia took great care not to let her
know he came without her consent; and therefore
told her the queen his mother was in perfect health,
and had enjoined him to pay her duty to her. Then
the queen presented him to the princesses; and
while he was in conversation with them, she left
him, and went with king Saleh into a closet. He
there told her how the king of Persia was fallen in
love with the princess Giahaure, upon the bare relation
of her beauty; and, contrary to his intention,
that he had brought him along with him, without
being able to hinder it, and that he was going to
concert measures to procure the princess for him in
marriage.</p>
<p>Although king Saleh was, to do him justice, perfectly
innocent of the king of Persia&rsquo;s passion, yet
the queen could hardly forgive his indiscretion, in
mentioning the princess Giahaure before him. Your
imprudence is beyond parallel, said she to him: can
you think that the king of Samarcand, whose character
is so well known, will have greater consideration
for you than the many other kings he has refused his
daughter to with scorn and contempt? Would you
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
have him send you away with the same confusion he
has done them?</p>
<p>Madam, replied king Saleh, I have told you it was
contrary to my intention that the king my nephew
heard what I related of the beauty of the princess
Giahaure to the queen my sister. The fault, if it be
one, is already committed; and we must consider
what a violent passion he has for this princess, and
that he will die with grief and affliction if we do not
speedily obtain her for him, with whatever trouble
we are to do it. For my part, I shall omit nothing
that may contribute to it, since I was, though innocently,
the cause of the malady: I will therefore do
all that I can to remedy it. I hope, madam, you
will approve of my resolution, to go and wait upon
the king of Samarcand, with a rich present of precious
stones, and demand the princess his daughter of him
for the king of Persia, your grandson and my nephew.
I have some reason to believe he will not
refuse me, nor neglect to ally himself with one of the
greatest potentates of the earth.</p>
<p>It were to have been wished, replied the queen,
that we had not been under a necessity of making
this demand, since the success of our attempt is not
so certain as we could desire; but since my grandson&rsquo;s
quiet and content totally depend upon it, I
freely give my consent to it. But, above all, I
charge you, since you sufficiently know the humour
of the king of Samarcand, that you take care to show
him due respect, and not in any wise offend him by
too presuming a behaviour.</p>
<p>The queen prepared the present herself, composing
it of diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and strings of
pearl; all which she put into a box, very neat and
very rich. Next morning, king Saleh took his
leave of her majesty and the king of Persia, and departed
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
with a chosen but small troop of officers and
other attendants. He soon arrived at the capital
and palace of the king of Samarcand, who did not
scruple to afford him audience immediately upon his
arrival. He rose from his throne as soon as he perceived
king Saleh; who, being willing to forget his
character for some moments, knowing whom he had
to deal with, prostrated himself at his feet, wishing
him an accomplishment of whatever he desired. The
king of Samarcand immediately stooped to take him
up; and, after he had placed him by him on his left-hand,
he told him he was welcome, and asked him if
there was any thing he could do to serve him.</p>
<p>Sir, answered king Saleh, though I should have no
other motive than that of rendering my respects to
the most potent and most prudent prince in the
world, yet would I endeavour to convince your majesty,
though poorly, how much I honour and adore
you. Were it possible you could penetrate into my
inmost soul, you would soon be convinced of the
great veneration I have had for you, and the ardent
desire I entertain to pay you my most humble acknowledgments.
Having spoken these words, he
took the box of jewels from one of his servants, and
having opened it, presented it to the king, imploring
him to accept of it for his sake.</p>
<p>Prince, replied the king of Samarcand, I hope you
do not make me this present without requiring a
proportional benefit from me. If there be any thing
within the compass of my capacity, you may freely
command it, and will do me signal honour in accepting
it. Speak, and tell me frankly wherein I can
serve you.</p>
<p>I must own ingenuously, replied king Saleh, I
have a boon to ask of your majesty; but I shall take
care to ask nothing but what is within your power to
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
grant. The thing depends so absolutely on yourself,
that it would be to no purpose to require it of
any other. I ask it then with all possible earnestness,
and I beg of you not to refuse it me. If it be
so, replied the king of Samarcand, you have nothing
to do but to acquaint me what it is, and you shall
see after what manner I can oblige people of desert.</p>
<p>Sir, then said king Saleh, after the confidence your
majesty has been pleased to think I have put in your
good-will, I will not dissemble any longer, that I
came to beg of you to honour our house with your
alliance by marriage, and by that means to fortify the
good understanding that has always hitherto been
between our two crowns.</p>
<p>At these words, the king of Samarcand began to
laugh heartily, falling back in his throne against a
cushion that supported him; and soon after said,
with an injurious and scornful air, to king Saleh;
King Saleh, I have always hitherto thought you were
a prince of great sense and wisdom; but now I find
you just the contrary. Tell me, I beseech you, where
was your wit or discretion, when you formed to
yourself so great a chimera as you have just now
proposed to me? Could you conceive a thought only
of aspiring in marriage to so great a princess as my
daughter? You ought to have considered better the
great distance between us, and not to run the risk of
losing in a moment the esteem I always had for your
person.</p>
<p>King Saleh was extremely nettled at this affronting
answer, and had much ado to restrain his just
resentment: however he replied, with greater moderation
than could be expected, God reward your
majesty according as you deserve. I beg the honour
to inform you, I do not demand the princess in marriage
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
for myself: had I done so, your majesty, or the
princess, ought to have been so far from being offended,
that you might rather have taken it for an
honour done to both. Your majesty knows well I am
a king of the sea as well as yourself; that the kings
my ancestors have no reason to yield in antiquity to
any other royal families; and that the kingdom I
inherit from them is no less potent and flourishing
than it has ever been. If your majesty had not interrupted
me, you had soon understood, that the favour
I asked of you was not for myself, but for the
young king of Persia, my nephew, whose power and
grandeur, no less than his personal good qualities,
cannot be unknown to you. Every body acknowledges
the princess Giahaure to be one of the finest
ladies under the heavens; but it is at the same time
acknowledged by all, that the young king of Persia,
my nephew, is as accomplished as any prince, either
upon land or under the water. Thus the favour
that is asked being likely to redound both to the honour
of your majesty and the princess your daughter,
you ought not to delay your consent to an alliance
so equal, and which no doubt will be approved by
the generality of people. The princess is worthy of
the king of Persia, and the king of Persia is no less
worthy of her. No king or prince in the world can
deny me this.</p>
<p>The king of Samarcand had not let king Saleh
go on so long after this rate, had not the rage he put
him in deprived him of all power of speech. He was
moreover some time longer before he could find his
tongue, so much was he transported with passion.
At length, however, he broke out into outrageous
and injurious expressions, unworthy of a king. Dog,
says he aloud, dare you talk to me after this manner,
and so much as once to mention my daughter&rsquo;s name
in my presence? Can you think the son of your sister
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
Gulnare worthy to come in competition with my
daughter? Who are you? who was your father? who
is your sister? and who your nephew? Was not his
father a dog, and a son of a dog, like thee? Guards,
seize the insolent wretch, and immediately cut off his
head.</p>
<p>The few officers that were about the king of Samarcand
were immediately going to obey his orders,
when king Saleh, who was in the flower of his age,
nimble and vigorous, got from them before they
could draw their sabres; and, having reached the
palace gate, he there found a thousand men of his relations
and friends, well armed and equipped, who
were but just arrived. The queen his mother having
considered the small number of attendants he took
with him, and moreover foreseeing the bad reception
he would probably have from the king of Samarcand,
had sent these troops to protect and defend him,
in case of danger. Those of his relations who were
at the head of this troop immediately saw how seasonably
they were arrived, when they beheld him and
his companions come running in great disorder, and
a small number of officers at their heels in pursuit of
them. My lord, cried out his friends, at the moment
he joined them, what is the matter? We are
ready to revenge you; you need only command us.</p>
<p>King Saleh related his case to them in as few
words as he could; and afterwards putting himself
at the head of a large troop, he, whilst some seized
on the gates, re-entered the palace as before. The
few officers and guards who had pursued him being
soon dispersed, he re-entered the king of Samarcand&rsquo;s
apartment, who, being abandoned by his attendants,
was soon seized. King Saleh left sufficient guards
to secure his person, and then went from apartment
to apartment, to search after the princess Giahaure.
But that princess, on the first noise of this alarm,
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
had, together with her women, flung herself on the
surface of the sea, and escaped to a desert island.</p>
<p>As matters passed thus in the palace of the king of
Samarcand, those of king Saleh&rsquo;s attendants, who had
fled at the first menaces of the king, put the queen
his mother into a terrible consternation, upon relating
the danger her son was in. King Beder, who
was by at that time, was the more concerned, in that
he looked upon himself as the principal author of all
the mischief that might ensue: therefore, not caring
to abide the queen&rsquo;s presence any longer, he, whilst
she was giving the necessary orders at that conjuncture,
darted himself upwards from the bottom of the
sea; and not knowing how to find his way to the
kingdom of Persia, he happened to light on the
same island where the princess Giahaure had saved
herself.</p>
<p>The prince, not a little disturbed in his mind, went
and seated himself under the shade of a large tree,
surrounded with divers others. Whilst he was endeavouring
to recover his temper, he heard one that
talked, but was too far off to understand what was
said. He arose, and advanced softly towards the
place whence the sound came, where, among the
branches, he perceived a beauty that dazzled him.
Doubtless, said he within himself, stopping, and
considering her with great attention, this must be
the princess Giahaure, whom fear has obliged to
abandon her father&rsquo;s palace; or, if it be not, she is,
at least, one that no less deserves my love and admiration.
This said, he moved forward, and discovering
himself, approached the princess with a profound
reverence. Madam, said he, I can never sufficiently
thank Heaven for the favour it has done me, in regaling
my eyes this day with so glorious a sight. A
greater blessing could not be conferred on me than
this opportunity to offer you my most humble services.
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
I beseech you, therefore, madam, to accept
them, it being impossible that a lady, under such
solitary circumstances, should not want assistance.</p>
<p>True, my lord, replied Giahaure, very sorrowfully,
it is not a little extraordinary for a lady of my quality
to be found in this condition. I am a princess,
daughter of the king of Samarcand, and my name is
Giahaure. As I was at ease in my father&rsquo;s palace,
and in my apartment, I all of a sudden heard a
dreadful noise: news was immediately brought me,
that king Saleh, I know not for what reason, had
fired the palace, seized upon the king my father, and
murdered all the guards that made any resistance.
I had only time to save myself, and escape hither
from his violence.</p>
<p>At these words of the princess, king Beder began
to be concerned that he had quitted his grandmother
so hastily, without staying to hear from her
the news that had been brought her; but he was, on
the other hand, overjoyed to find that the king his
uncle had rendered himself master of the king of Samarcand&rsquo;s
person, not doubting but he would consent
to give up the princess for his liberty. Adorable
princess, continued he, your concern is most just;
but it is easy to put an end both to that and your
father&rsquo;s captivity. You will agree with me, when I
shall tell you that I am Beder, king of Persia, and
king Saleh is my uncle. I assure you, madam, he
has no design to seize upon the king your father&rsquo;s
dominions: his only intent is, to obtain of him that
I may have the honour to be received for his son-in-law.
I had already given my heart to you, upon the
bare relation of your charming beauty; and now,
very far from repenting of what I have done, I beg
of you to accept it, and to be assured that I will love
you as long as I live. I dare flatter myself you will
not refuse this favour, but be ready to acknowledge,
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
that a king that quitted his dominions purely on your
account deserves some favour. Permit then, beauteous
princess, that I may have the honour to go and
present you to the king my uncle; and the king your
father shall no sooner have consented to our marriage,
than king Saleh will leave him sovereign of his
dominions as before.</p>
<p>This declaration of king Beder had not all the
success he could have desired. It is true the princess
no sooner saw his person, and the good mien
wherewith he accosted her, than she had some kindness
for him; but when she came to understand
from his own mouth that he had been the occasion of
all the ill treatment her father had undergone, of the
grief and fright she had endured, and especially the
necessity she was reduced to in flying her country
to save her life, she looked upon him with that horror,
that she considered him rather as an enemy than
a friend, with whom she resolved to have no manner
of converse. Moreover, whatever inclination she
might by any means be thought to have in regard to
this marriage, she determined never to yield to it, in
consideration that one of the reasons her father might
have against this match might be, that king Beder
was son of a king of the earth; and therefore she
proposed to obey her father, especially in that particular.</p>
<p>She nevertheless resolved to let king Beder know
nothing of her resentment, and only sought an occasion
to deliver herself dexterously out of his hands,
seeming, in the mean time, to have a great kindness
for him. Are you then, said she, with all possible
civility, son of the queen Gulnare, so famous for her
wit and beauty? I am highly glad of it, and moreover
rejoice that you are the son of so worthy a mother.
The king my father was much in the wrong for so
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
strongly opposing our conjunction: he could no
sooner have seen you but he must have consented to
have made us both happy. Saying these words, she
reached forth her hand to him as a token of friendship.</p>
<p>King Beder, believing himself arrived at the very
pinnacle of happiness held forth his hand, and was
stooping to take that of the princess to kiss it, when
she, pushing him back, and spitting at him, said,
Wretch, quit that form of a man, and take one of a
white bird, with a red bill and feet. Upon her pronouncing
these words, king Beder was immediately
changed into a bird of that sort, to his great surprise
and astonishment. Take him now, said she to one of
her women, and carry him to the Desert Island. This
island was only one frightful rock, where there was
not a drop of water to be had.</p>
<p>The waiting-woman took the bird; and, in executing
the princess&rsquo;s orders, had compassion on king
Beder&rsquo;s destiny. It would be great pity, said she
to herself, to let a prince, so worthy to live, die of
hunger and thirst. The princess will, it may be, repent
of what she has ordered, when she comes again
to herself: it were better that I carried him to a
place where he may die a natural death. She then
carried him to a well-frequented island, and left him
on a charming plain, planted with all sorts of fruit-trees,
and watered by divers rivulets.</p>
<p>Let us now return to king Saleh, who, after he had
sought a good while for the princess Giahaure, and
ordered others to seek for her, to no purpose, caused
the king of Samarcand to be shut up in his palace,
under a good guard; and, having given the necessary
orders for governing the kingdom in his absence,
he returned to give the queen his mother an
account of what he had done. The first thing he
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
asked, upon his arrival, was, Where was the king
his nephew? and he was answered, to his great surprise
and astonishment, that he disappeared soon
after he left him. News being brought me, said the
queen, of the danger you was in at the palace of the
king of Samarcand, while I was giving orders to send
troops for you to revenge yourself, he disappeared.
He must necessarily have been frightened at the
hearing of your being in so great danger, and did not
think himself in sufficient security with us.</p>
<p>This news exceedingly afflicted king Saleh, who
now repented of his being so easily wrought upon by
king Beder, as to carry him away with him without
his mother&rsquo;s consent. He sent every where after
him; but whatever diligence was used, he could hear
no news of him; and instead of the joy he conceived
at having carried on the marriage so far, which he
looked upon as his own work, he felt a grief for this
accident that was mortifying to him. While he was
under suspense about his nephew, he left his kingdom
to the administration of his mother, and went
and governed that of the king of Samarcand, whom he
continued to keep with great vigilance, though with
all due respect to his character.</p>
<p>The same day that king Saleh returned to the
kingdom of Samarcand, queen Gulnare, mother to
king Beder, arrived at the court of the queen her
mother. The princess was not at all surprised to find
her son did not return the same day he set out; because
it was common for him to go farther than he
proposed, in the heat of the chase: but when she
saw he neither returned the next day nor the day
after that, she began to be alarmed, as may easily
be imagined, from the kindness she professed for
him. This alarm was considerably augmented, when
the officers who had accompanied the king, and were
retired, after they had for a long time sought in vain
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
both for him and his uncle, came and told her majesty
they must of necessity have come to some
harm, since, whatever diligence they had used, they
had heard no tidings of them. Their horses, indeed,
they had found; but, as for their persons, they knew
not where to look for them. The queen, hearing this,
dissembled and concealed her affliction, bidding the
officers go and search once more with their utmost
diligence; but in the mean time, saying nothing to
any body, she went and plunged into the sea, to satisfy
herself in the suspicion she had that king Saleh
must have carried away his nephew along with
him.</p>
<p>This great queen would have been the more affectionately
received by the queen her mother, had she
not, upon first sight of her, guessed the occasion of
her coming. Daughter, said she, I plainly perceive
you are not come hither to visit me; you come only
to inquire after the king your son; and I can only
tell you such news of him as will augment both your
grief and mine. I must confess, I no sooner saw
him arrive in our territories, than I greatly rejoiced:
yet, when I came to understand he had come away
without your knowledge, I began to partake with you
in the concern you must needs have at it. Then she
related to her with what zeal king Saleh went to demand
the princess Giahaure in marriage for king
Beder, and what happened upon it, till such time as
her son disappeared. I have sent diligently after
him, added she; and the king my son, who is just
gone to govern the kingdom of Samarcand, has done
all that lay in his power on his part. All our endeavours
have hitherto proved unsuccessful; but we
hope nevertheless to see him again, perhaps when we
least expect it.</p>
<p>Comfortless queen Gulnare was not satisfied with
this hope: she looked upon the king her dear son as
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
lost; and she lamented him grievously, laying all the
blame upon the king his uncle. The queen her mother
made her to consider the necessity there was of her
not yielding too much to her grief. The king your
brother, said she, ought not, it is true, to have talked
to you so inconsiderately about that marriage, nor
ever have consented to carry away the king your son
without your privacy: yet, since it is not certain
that the king of Persia is absolutely lost, you ought
to neglect nothing to preserve his kingdom for him.
Lose then no more time; but return to your capital:
your presence there will be necessary; and it will
not be hard for you to preserve the public peace, by
causing it to be published that the king of Persia was
gone to visit his grandmother.</p>
<p>This reason was sufficient to oblige queen Gulnare
to submit to it. She took leave of the queen her
mother, and was got back to the palace of her capital
of Persia before she had been missed. She despatched
immediately persons to recall the officers she
had sent after the king, and to tell them she knew
where his majesty was, and that they should soon
see him again. She also caused the same report to
be spread throughout the city, and governed, in
concert with the prime minister and council, with
the same tranquillity as if the king had been present.</p>
<p>To return to king Beder, whom the princess Giahaure&rsquo;s
waiting-woman had carried and left in the
island before mentioned. That monarch was not a
little surprised when he found himself alone, and under
the form of a bird. He esteemed himself more
unhappy, in that he knew not where he was, nor in
what part of the world the kingdom of Persia lay.
But if he had known, and sufficiently knew the force
of his wings to traverse so vast watery regions, what
could he have gained by it, but the mortification to
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
continue still in the same ill plight, not to be accounted
so much as a man, in the lieu of being acknowledged
for king of Persia? He was then in a
manner constrained to remain where he was, and live
upon such nourishment as birds of his kind were
wont to have.</p>
<p>A few days after, a peasant, who was skilled in
taking birds with nets, chanced to come to the place
where he was; when, perceiving this fine bird, the
like of which he had never seen, though he had used
that sport for a long while, he began greatly to rejoice.
He employed all his art to become master of him;
and at length used such proper methods, that he took
him. Overjoyed at so great a prize, which he looked
upon to be of more worth than all the other birds
he commonly took, by reason of its being so great a
rarity, he shut it up in a cage, and carried it to the
city. As soon as he was come into the market, a
citizen stopped him, and asked him how much he
would have for that bird.</p>
<p>Instead of answering, the peasant demanded of the
citizen what he would do with him in case he should
buy him. What wouldst thou have me do with him,
answered the citizen, but roast and eat him? Very
well, replied the peasant; and so, I suppose, you
would think me very well paid if you should give me
the smallest piece of money for him: but know, I
set a much greater value upon him; and you should
not have him for a large piece of gold. Although I
am pretty well advanced in years, I never saw such a
bird in my life. I intend to make a present to the
king of him; and I am sure he will know the worth
of him better than you.</p>
<p>Without staying any longer in the market, the peasant
went directly to the court, and placed himself
exactly before the king&rsquo;s apartment. His majesty
being at a window where he could see all that passed
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
in the base-court, at length cast his eyes on this
beautiful bird; and, being charmed with the sight of
it, he immediately sent the commander of his eunuchs
to buy it for him. The officer, going to the
peasant, demanded of him how much he would have
for that bird. If it be for his majesty, answered the
peasant, I humbly beg of him to accept it of me as a
present, and I desire you to carry it to him. Hereupon
the officer took the bird, and brought it to the
king, who found it so great a rarity, that he ordered
the same officer to take ten pieces of gold and carry
them to the peasant, who departed very well satisfied
with the market he had made. The king ordered the
bird to be put into a magnificent cage, and gave it
corn and water in rich vessels.</p>
<p>His majesty being then ready to mount on horseback,
had not time to consider the bird, therefore had
it brought to him as soon as he came back. The
officer brought the cage; and the king, that he might
better view the bird, took it out himself, and perched
it upon his hand. Looking earnestly upon it, he demanded
of the officer if he had seen it eat. Sir, replied
the officer, your majesty may observe his eating:
the drawer is still full; and I believe he has
hardly touched any of his meat; at least I did not see
him. Then the king ordered him meat of divers
sorts, that he might take what he liked best.</p>
<p>The table being spread, (for dinner happened to
be served up just as the king had given these orders),
and the plates being placed, the bird leaped off the
king&rsquo;s hand, and, clapping his wings, flew upon the
table, where he began to peck the bread and victuals
after an extraordinary rate. The king seeing this,
was so surprised at it, that he immediately sent for
the queen to come and see this miracle. The person
that was sent related the matter to her majesty, and
she came forthwith; but she no sooner saw the bird,
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
than she covered her face with her veil, and would
have retired. The king, admiring her proceedings,
in that there were none but the eunuchs of the chamber
and the women that waited on her, asked the
reason of it.</p>
<p>Sir, answered the queen, your majesty will no
longer admire at my proceeding, when you come to
know that this bird, which you take to be such, is
no bird, but a man. Madam, said the king, more
astonished than before, you are pleased to banter me,
I suppose; but you shall never persuade me that a
bird can be a man. Sir, replied the queen, far be it
from me to banter your majesty; yet nothing is more
certain than what I have had the honour to tell you.</p>
<p>I can assure your majesty it is the king of Persia,
named Beder, son of the celebrated Gulnare, princess
of one of the largest kingdoms of the sea, nephew of
Saleh, king of that kingdom, and grand-child of queen
Farasche, mother of Gulnare and Saleh; and it was
the princess Giahaure, daughter of the king of Samarcand,
who thus metamorphosed him into a bird.
Moreover, that the king might no longer doubt of
what she affirmed, she told him the whole story, as
how, and for what reason, the princess Giahaure had
thus revenged herself for the ill treatment which king
Saleh had used towards the king of Samarcand, her
father.</p>
<p>The king had the less difficulty to believe this assertion
of the queen&rsquo;s, in that he knew her to be a
skilful sorceress, perhaps one of the greatest in the
world; and as she knew every thing which passed in
it, he was always timely informed of the designs of
the kings his neighbours against him, and so prevented
them. His majesty had compassion on the
king of Persia, and therefore earnestly besought his
queen to break the enchantment, that he might return
to his own form.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>The queen consented to it with great willingness.
Sir, said she to the king, be pleased to take the bird
into your closet, and I will show you a thing worthy
of the consideration you have for him. The bird,
which had never minded eating, by reason of his attentiveness
to what the king and queen said, would
not give his majesty the trouble to take him, but hopped
into the closet before him; and the queen came
in soon after, with a pot full of water in her hand.
She mumbled over the pot some words, unknown to
the king, till such time as the water began to boil;
when she took some of it in her hand, and sprinkling
a little upon the bird, said, By virtue of these holy
and mysterious words I am going to pronounce, and
in the name of the Creator both of heaven and earth,
who raises the dead, and maintains the universe in its
distinct state, quit that form of a bird, and reassume
that form which thou receivedst from thy Creator.</p>
<p>The words were scarce out of the queen&rsquo;s mouth,
when, instead of a bird, the king saw a young prince of
good shape, air, and mien. King Beder immediately
fell on his knees, and thanked God for the mercy that
had been bestowed upon him. Then he took the
king&rsquo;s hand, who helped him up, and kissed it as a
token of his acknowledgment; but the king embraced
him with a great deal of joy, and testified to him the
great satisfaction he had to see him. He would then
have paid his acknowledgments to the queen, but she
was already retired to her apartment. The king
made him sit at the table with him, and after supper
was over, he prayed him to relate to him how the
princess Giahaure had had the inhumanity to transform
him into a bird, so agreeable and amiable a
prince as he was; and the king of Persia immediately
applied himself to satisfy him. When he had done,
the king, disdaining the proceeding of the princess,
could not help blaming her. It was commendable,
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
said he, in the princess of Samarcand, not to be insensible
of the king her father&rsquo;s ill treatment; but to
carry her vengeance so far, and especially against one
that was not culpable, was by no means to be excused,
and she will never be able to justify herself.
But let us have done with this discourse, and tell me,
I beseech you, in what I can farther serve you.</p>
<p>Sir, answered king Beder, my obligation to your
majesty has been so great, that I ought to remain
with you all my life-time to testify my acknowledgments;
but since your majesty has set no limits to
your generosity, I humbly entreat you to grant me
one of your ships to transport me to Persia, where I
fear my absence, which has been but too long, may
have occasioned some disorder; and moreover, that
the queen my mother, from whom I concealed my departure,
may be dead of grief, under the uncertainty
she must needs be of my life or of my death.</p>
<p>The king granted what he desired with all the
good will imaginable, and immediately gave orders
for equipping one of his largest ships and best sailers
in all his numerous fleet. The ship was soon furnished
with all its complement of men, provisions, and
ammunition; and as soon as the wind became fair,
king Beder embarked, after having taken leave of the
king, and thanked him for all his favours.</p>
<p>The ship sailed before the wind for ten days together,
which made it advance considerably. The eleventh
day the wind changed, and becoming very violent,
there followed a furious tempest. The ship was
not only driven out of its course, but so grievously
agitated, that all its masts were thrown overboard;
and driving along at the pleasure of the wind, it at
length struck against a rock and bulged.</p>
<p>The greatest part of the people were drowned,
though some few were saved by swimming, and others
by getting on pieces of the wreck. King Beder was
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
one of the last; when, after having been tossed about
for some time under great uncertainty of his fate, he
at length perceived himself near the shore, and not
far from a city that seemed large. He used his utmost
endeavours to reach the land, and was at length
so fortunate to come so near as to be able to touch
the ground with his feet. He then immediately abandoned
his piece of wood, which had been of so great
service to him; but when he came pretty near the
shore, he was greatly surprised to see horses, camels,
mules, asses, oxen, cows, bulls, and other animals,
crowding towards the shore, and putting themselves
in a posture to oppose his landing. He had all the
difficulty in the world to conquer their obstinacy, and
force his way; but at length he did it, which when
done, he sheltered himself among the rocks till such
time as he had recovered his breath, and dried his
clothes in the sun.</p>
<p>When the prince advanced to enter the city, he
met with the same opposition from these animals,
who seemed to intend to make him forego his design,
and give him to understand it was dangerous to
proceed.</p>
<p>King Beder, however, got into the city soon after,
and saw many fair and spacious streets, but was surprised
to find never a man there. This made him
think it was not without a cause that so many animals
had opposed his passage. Going forward, nevertheless,
he observed divers shops open, which gave him
reason to believe the place was not destitute of inhabitants,
as he imagined. He approached one of these
shops, where several sorts of fruits were exposed to
sale, and saluted very courteously an old man that
was sitting there.</p>
<p>The old man, who was busy about something,
suddenly lifted up his head, and seeing a youth
that showed some grandeur in his air, started, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
asked him whence he came, and what business had
brought him hither. King Beder satisfied him in a
few words; and the old man farther asked him, if he
had met any body on the road. You are the first
person I have seen, answered the king; and I cannot
comprehend how so fine and large a city comes to be
without inhabitants. Come in, sir, stay no longer on
the threshold, replied the old man, or peradventure
some misfortune may happen to you. I will satisfy
your curiosity at leisure, and give you a reason why
it is necessary you should take this precaution.</p>
<p>King Beder would not be bid twice. He entered
the shop, and sat himself down by the old man. The
old man, who had learned from him an account of his
misfortunes, knew he must needs want nourishment,
therefore immediately presented him with what was
necessary to recover his spirits; and, although king
Beder was very earnest to know why he gave him
that precaution before he entered the shop, he would
nevertheless not be prevailed upon to tell him any
thing till he had done eating, for fear the sad things
he had to relate might balk his appetite. In a word,
when he found he ate no longer, he said to him, You
have great reason to thank God you got hither without
any ill accident. Alas! why? replied king Beder,
very much surprised and alarmed.</p>
<p>Because, answered he, this city is the city of enchantments,
and governed not by a king, but a queen,
who is not only one of the finest women of her sex,
but likewise a dangerous sorceress. You will be convinced
of this, added he, when you come to know
that these horses, mules, and other animals that you
have seen, are so many men like you and me, whom
she has transformed by her diabolical art: and for
young men like you only, that come to enter into the
city, she has hired servants to stop and bring them,
either by good will or force, before her. She receives
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
them with all the seeming civility in the world: she
caresses them, she treats and lodges them magnificently,
and gives them so many reasons to believe
that she loves them, that they think they cannot be
mistaken. But she does not suffer them to enjoy
long their happiness. Not one of them but she has
transformed into some animal or bird, within the
space of forty days. You told me those animals presented
themselves to oppose your landing, and hinder
your entering the city; and I must now tell you they
were your friends, and what they did was to make
you comprehend the danger you were going to expose
yourself to.</p>
<p>This account afflicted exceedingly the young king of
Persia. Alas! cried he out aloud, to what extremities
has my ill fortune reduced me! I am hardly freed
from one enchantment, which I look back upon with
horror, but I incur another much more terrible to
me. This gave him occasion to relate his story to the
old man much more at length, and to acquaint him
of his birth and quality, his passion for the princess
of Samarcand, and her cruelty in changing him into
a bird, the very moment he came to see and declare
his love to her.</p>
<p>When the prince came to that passage where he
spoke of his good fortune in finding a queen that
broke the enchantment, the old man said to him,
Notwithstanding all I have told you of the magic
queen being true, yet that ought not to give you the
least disquiet, since I am generally beloved throughout
the city, and am not even unknown to the queen
herself, who has no small respect for me; therefore
it was your peculiar happiness to address yourself to
me rather than elsewhere. You are secure in my
house, where I advise you to continue, if you think
fit; and, provided, you do not stray from hence, I dare
assure you, you will have no just cause to complain of
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
my breach of faith; so that you are under no sort of
constraint whatsoever.</p>
<p>King Beder thanked the old man for his kind reception
of him, and the protection he was pleased to
afford him. Then he sat down at the entrance into the
shop, where he no sooner appeared, than his youth
and good mien drew the eyes of all that passed that
way on him. Many stopped and complimented the old
man on his having so fine a slave, as they imagined
the king to be; and they could not comprehend how
so beautiful a youth could escape the queen&rsquo;s knowledge.
Believe not, said the old man, this is a slave:
you all know I am not rich enough to have one of
this consequence: he is my nephew, son of a brother
of mine that is dead; and as I had no children of my
own, I sent for him to keep me company. They all
congratulated his good fortune, in having so fine a
young man for his relation; but withal told him,
they feared the queen would take him from him.
You know her well, said they to him; and you cannot
be ignorant of the danger you expose yourself and
nephew to, after all the examples you have seen of
the kind. How grieved would you be, if she should
serve you as she has done so many others!</p>
<p>I am obliged to you, gentlemen, replied the old
man, for your good will towards me, and I thank you
for the care you seem to take of my interest; but I
shall never entertain the least thought that the queen
will do me any injury, after all the kindness she has
professed for me. In case she happens to hear of this
young man, and speaks to me about him, I doubt not
but she will be contented to excuse him, as soon as
she comes to know he is my nephew.</p>
<p>The old man was exceedingly glad to hear the commendations
they bestowed on the young king of Persia.
He was as much affected with them as if he had
been his own son; and he conceived such a kindness
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
for him, as augmented every day during the stay he
made with him. They lived about a month together,
when king Beder, sitting at the shop-door after his
ordinary manner, queen Labe (so was this magic
queen&rsquo;s name) happened to come by with great pomp.
The young king no sooner perceived the guards coming,
who marched before her, than he arose, and going
into the shop, asked the old man what all that show
meant. The queen is coming by, answered he; but
stand you still, and fear nothing.</p>
<p>The queen&rsquo;s guards, clothed in purple, and well
armed and mounted, marched in four files, with their
sabres drawn, to the number of a thousand, and not
one of their officers but, as they passed by the shop,
saluted the old man. Then followed a like number
of eunuchs habited in brocade silk, and better mounted,
whose officers did the old man the like honours.
Next came as many young ladies on foot, equally
beautiful, richly dressed, and set off with precious
stones. They marched gravely, with half pikes in
their hands; and in the midst of them appeared queen
Labe, on a horse all glittering with diamonds, with a
golden saddle, and a housing of inestimable price.
All the young ladies saluted the old man as they
passed by him; and the queen, moved with the good
mien of king Beder, stopped as soon as she came
over-against the shop. Abdallah, (so was the old
man&rsquo;s name,) said she to him, tell me, I beseech thee,
does that beautiful and charming slave belong to
thee, and is it long that thou hast been in possession
of him?</p>
<p>Abdallah, before he answered the queen, threw
himself on the ground, and rising again, said, Madam,
he is my nephew, son of a brother I had, who has
been dead for some time. Having no children, I
look upon him as my son, and sent for him to come
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
and comfort me, intending to leave him what I have
when I die.</p>
<p>Queen Labe, who had never yet seen any one that
pleased her so well as king Beder, and who began to
conceive a mighty passion for him, thought immediately
of getting the old man to abandon him to her.
Father, quoth she, will not you oblige me so far as to
make me a present of this young man? Do not refuse
me, I conjure you; and I swear by the fire and the
light, I will make him as great and powerful as ever
private man was in the world. Although my design
be to do evil to all mankind, yet he shall be the sole
exception. I trust you will grant me what I desire,
more on account of the friendship you have for me,
than the esteem you know I have always had, and
shall ever have, for your person.</p>
<p>Madam, replied the good Abdallah, I am infinitely
obliged to your majesty for all the kindness you have
for me, and the honours you propose to do my nephew.
He is not worthy to approach so great a
queen, and I humbly beseech your majesty to excuse
him.</p>
<p>Abdallah, replied the queen, I all along flattered
myself you loved me, and I could never have thought
you would have given me so evident a token of your
slighting my request: but I swear once more by the
fire and light, and even by whatsoever is most sacred
in my religion, that I will pass on no farther until I
have conquered thy obstinacy. I understand very
well what raises fears in thee; but I here promise,
thou shalt never have any occasion to repent thy
having trusted me.</p>
<p>Old Abdallah was exceedingly grieved, in relation
to king Beder and himself, for being in a manner
forced to obey the queen. Madam, therefore, replied
he, I would not willingly have your majesty have an
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
ill opinion of the sincere respect I have for you, but
would always contribute whatever I can to oblige
you: I put an entire confidence in your royal word,
and I do not in the least doubt but you will keep it:
I only beg of your majesty to delay doing this great
honour to my nephew till you shall again pass by this
way. That shall be to-morrow, quoth the queen; and
so saying, she inclined her head, as a token of her
being pleased, and so went forward towards her
palace.</p>
<p>When queen Labe and all her attendants were out
of sight, the good Abdallah said to king Beder, Son,
(for so he was wont to call him, for fear of some time
or other betraying himself in public,) it has not been
in my power, as you may have observed, to refuse
the queen what she demanded of me with so great
earnestness, to the end I might not force her to an
extremity of employing her magic both against you
and myself. But I have some reason to believe she
will use you well, as she promised, on account of that
particular esteem she professes for me. This you may
have seen, by the respect both she and all her court
paid me. She would be a cursed creature indeed, if
she should deceive me; but in case she should, she
shall not deceive me unrevenged, for I know how to
be even with her.</p>
<p>All these assurances, which appeared very doubtful,
were not sufficient to support king Beder&rsquo;s spirits.
After all you have told me of this queen&rsquo;s wickedness,
replied he, you cannot wonder if I am somewhat fearful
to approach her. I should, it may be, slight all
you could tell me of her, and suffer myself to be dazzled
by the lustre of grandeur that surrounds her, if I
had not already been at the mercy of a sorceress. The
condition I was in, through the enchantment of the
princess Giahaure, and from whence I was delivered
only to enter anew into another, has made me look upon
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
such a fate with horror. His tears hindered him from
going on any farther, and sufficiently showed with
what repugnance he held himself in a manner under
a fatal necessity of being delivered to queen Labe.</p>
<p>Son, replied old Abdallah, do not afflict yourself;
for though I must own there is no great stress to be
laid upon the oaths and promises of so perfidious a
queen, yet I must withal acquaint you, her power
extends no farther than I am pleased to permit it: she
knows it full well herself; and that is the reason, and
no other, that she pays me so great respect. I can
quickly hinder her from doing you the least harm,
though she should be perfidious enough to attempt it.
You may entirely depend upon me; and, provided you
follow exactly the advice I shall give you before I
abandon you to her, she shall have no more power
over you than she has over me.</p>
<p>The magic queen did not fail to pass by the old
man&rsquo;s shop the next day, with the same pomp she had
done the day before; and Abdallah waited for her
with great respect. Father, cried she, stopping just
against him, you may judge of my impatience to have
your nephew with me, by my punctual coming to put
you in mind of your promise: I know you are a man
of your word, and I cannot think you will break it
with me.</p>
<p>Abdallah, who fell on his knees as soon as he saw
the queen approaching, rose up when she had done
speaking; and as he would have nobody hear what he
had a mind to say to her, he advanced with great respect
as far as her horse&rsquo;s head, and then said softly,
Puissant queen! I am persuaded your majesty will
not be offended at my seeming unwillingness to trust
my nephew with you yesterday, since you cannot be
ignorant of the reasons I had for it; but I conjure you
to lay aside the secrets of that art which you possess
in so wonderful a degree. I respect my nephew as
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
my own son; and your majesty would reduce me to
the utmost despair, if you should think fit to deal
with him as you have done with others.</p>
<p>I promise you once more I will not, replied the
queen; and I once more repeat the oath I made yesterday,
that neither you nor your nephew shall have
any cause to be offended at me. I see plainly, added
she, you are not yet well enough acquainted with me:
you never saw me yet but through a veil; but as I
find your nephew worthy of my friendship, I will show
you I am not any wise unworthy of his. With that
she threw off her veil, and discovered to king Beder,
who came near her with Abdallah, an incomparable
face: but king Beder was little charmed. It is not
enough, said he within himself, to be beautiful;
one&rsquo;s actions ought to correspond in regularity with
one&rsquo;s features.</p>
<p>While king Beder was making these reflections,
with his eyes fixed on queen Labe, the old man turned
towards him, and, taking him by the arm, presented
him to her majesty, saying, Here he is, madam; and
I beg of your majesty once more to remember he is
my nephew, and to let him come and see me sometimes.
The queen promised he should; and, to give
a farther assurance of her acknowledgment, she caused
a bag of a thousand pieces of gold to be given him.
He excused himself at first from receiving them; but
she insisted absolutely upon it, and he could not refuse
her. She had caused a horse to be brought, as
richly harnessed and set out as her own, for the king
of Persia. While he was mounting him, I forgot, said
the queen to Abdallah, to ask you your nephew&rsquo;s
name; pray how is he called? He answered, his name
was Beder, (The Full Moon); and her majesty replied,
Sure his ancestors were mistaken; they ought
to have given him the name of Shems, (The Sun).</p>
<p>When king Beder was mounted, he would have
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
taken his post behind the queen; but she would not
suffer him, and made him to ride on her left hand.
She looked upon Abdallah; and, after having made
him an inclination with her head, she set forward on
her march.</p>
<p>Instead of observing a satisfaction in the people&rsquo;s
faces at the sight of their sovereign, king Beder took
notice that they rather despised and cursed her. The
sorceress, said some, has got a new subject to exercise
her wickedness upon: will Heaven never deliver the
world from her tyranny? Poor stranger, cried out
others, thou art much deceived if thou thinkest thy
happiness will last long: it is to render thy fall more
terrible, that she has raised thee so high. This talk
gave king Beder to understand Abdallah had told him
nothing but the truth of queen Labe; but as he no
longer depended on him, he had recourse to divine
Providence to free him from the danger he was got
into.</p>
<p>The magic queen arrived at her palace, whither
she was no sooner come, than she alighted, and, giving
her hand to king Beder, entered with him, accompanied
by her women and the officers of her eunuchs.
She herself showed him all her apartments, where
there was nothing to be seen but massy gold, precious
stones, and furniture of wonderful magnificence.
When she had carried him into her closet, she led him
out into a balcony, from whence he observed a garden
of surprising beauty. King Beder commended all he
saw, with a great deal of wit, but nevertheless in such
a manner that he might not be discovered to be any
other than old Abdallah&rsquo;s nephew. They discoursed
of divers indifferent matters, till such time as news
was brought the queen that dinner was upon the
table.</p>
<p>The queen and king Beder arose, and went to place
themselves at table, which was of pure massy gold,
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
and the plates of the same. They began to eat, but
did not drink till almost the dessert came, when the
queen caused a cup to be filled with excellent wine:
she took it, and drank to king Beder&rsquo;s health; and
then causing it to be filled again, presented it to him.
King Beder received it with profound respect, and,
by a very low bow, signified to her majesty that he
likewise drank to her health.</p>
<p>Soon after, ten of queen Labe&rsquo;s women entered with
musical instruments, with which, accompanied with
their voices, they made an agreeable concert during
the whole drinking, which continued till late at night.
At length they began to be so heated with wine, that
king Beder insensibly forgot he had to do with a magic
queen, and looked upon her only as the finest
woman he ever saw. As soon as the queen perceived
she had wrought him to the pitch she desired, she
made a sign to her eunuchs and women to retire.
They obeyed; and king Beder and she went and lay
together all night.</p>
<p>Next morning the queen and king Beder went to
the bagnio; and as soon as they came out, the women
who had served the king there, presented him with
fine linen and a magnificent habit. The queen likewise,
who was more splendidly dressed than the day
before, came to receive him, and they went together
to her apartment, where they had a good repast brought
before them, and spent the remainder of the day in
walking and other amusements.</p>
<p>Queen Labe treated king Beder after this manner
for forty days, as she had been accustomed to do all
her lovers. The fortieth night, as they were lying together,
she, believing he was really asleep, arose without
making any noise; but he was awake, and perceiving
she had some design upon him, watched all
her motions. Being up, she opened a chest, from
whence she took a little box, full of a certain yellow
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
powder. Taking some of the powder, she laid a train
of it across the chamber, and immediately flowed in a
rivulet of water, to the great astonishment of king
Beder. He trembled with fear, but still pretended
to sleep, that he might not discover to the sorceress
he was awake.</p>
<p>Queen Labe next took up some of the water in a
pot, and poured it into a basin where there was flour,
with which she made paste, and kneaded it for a long
time: then she mixed certain drugs with it, which
she took from different boxes, and made a cake, and
put it into a covered baking-pan. As she had taken
care at first to make a good fire, she took some of the
coals, and set the pan upon them; and as the cake
was baking, she put up her pot and boxes again; and
at the pronouncing of certain words, dismissed the
rivulet, which appeared no more. When the cake
was baked, she took it off the coals, and carried it
into her closet, and afterwards returned to bed again
to king Beder, who dissembled the matter so well with
her, that she had not the least suspicion that he knew
any thing of what she had done.</p>
<p>King Beder, whom the pleasures and delights of
a court had made to forget his good host Abdallah,
began now to think of him again, and believed he had
more than ordinary occasion for his advice at this
juncture, since he saw all the queen had done that
night. As soon as he was up, therefore, he expressed
a great desire to go and see his uncle, and begged of
her majesty to permit him. Alas! my dear Beder,
cried the queen, are you then already tired, I will not
say with the pleasures of so superfine a palace as mine
is, but with the company of a queen who loves you so
passionately as I do?</p>
<p>Great queen, answered king Beder, how can I be
tired with so many favours and graces as your majesty
perpetually heaps upon me? Very far from that, I
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
desire this permission, madam, purely to go and give
my uncle an account of the mighty obligations I have
to your majesty. I must own likewise it is partly in
this respect, that my uncle loving me so tenderly, as
it is very well known he does, and I having been from
him now forty days, without so much as once seeing
him, he will surely take it very unkindly if I cannot
afford him one visit. Go, said the queen, I consent
to it; but you will not be long before you return, if
you consider I cannot possibly live without you. This
said, she ordered him a fine horse richly caparisoned,
and so he departed.</p>
<p>Old Abdallah was overjoyed to see his dear adopted
son again; insomuch that, without regard to his
quality, he embraced him heartily, and king Beder
returned the like, that nobody might doubt but that
he was his nephew. As soon as they were sat down,
Well, said Abdallah to the king, how do you do, sir?
and how have you passed your time with that infidel
sorceress?</p>
<p>Hitherto, answered king Beder, I must needs own
she has been extraordinary kind to me, and has done
all she could to persuade me that she loves me entirely;
but I observed something last night, which
gives me just reason to suspect that all her kindness
hitherto is but dissimulation. Whilst she thought me
asleep, although I was really awake, she stole from
me with a great deal of precaution, which made me
suspect her intention, and therefore I resolved to
watch her. Going on with his discourse, he related
to Abdallah how, and after what manner, he had seen
her make the cake; and then added, Hitherto, said
he, I must needs confess I had almost forgot, not only
you, but all the advice you gave me concerning the
wickedness of this queen: but this last action of hers
gives me reason to fear she neither intends to observe
any of her oaths nor promises. I thought of you immediately,
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
and esteem myself happy in that I have
obtained permission to come to you.</p>
<p>You are not deceived in this wicked queen, replied
old Abdallah with a smile, to show he did not himself
believe she would observe one word she spoke, nor oath
she made; nothing is capable of obliging a perfidious
woman to mend her morals. But fear nothing; I have
a way to make the mischief she intends you fall upon
herself. You are become jealous in time; and you
could not have done better than this, to have recourse
to me. It is her ordinary practice to keep her lovers
only forty days; and after that time, instead of sending
them home, to turn them into animals to stock
her forests and parks; but I thought of measures
yesterday to prevent her doing any harm. The earth
has borne this monster long enough, and it is now
high time she should be served as she deserves.</p>
<p>So saying, Abdallah put two cakes into king Beder&rsquo;s
hands, bidding him keep them to make use of as he
should direct. You told me, continued he, the sorceress
made a cake last night: it was for you to eat
of, depend upon it, but take great care you do not
touch it. Nevertheless, do not refuse to receive it
when she offers it you; but, instead of tasting it,
break off part of one of the two that I gave you, unobserved,
and eat that. As soon as she thinks you
have swallowed it, she will not fail to attempt transforming
you into some animal, but she shall not succeed;
which when she sees, she will immediately
turn the thing to pleasantry, as if what she had done
was only to frighten you; but she will conceal a mortal
aversion in her heart, and think her having failed
proceeded only from the want of something in the
composition of her cake. As for the cake she made,
and which she will not know to be her own, you shall
make a present of it to her, and press her to eat it;
which she will not refuse to do, if it were only to convince
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
you she does not mistrust you, though she has
given you so much reason to mistrust her. When she
has quite eaten it, take a little water in the hollow of
your hand, and, throwing it in her face, say, Quit that
form you now wear, and take that of such or such an
animal, as you shall think fit; which done, come to
me with the animal, and I will tell you what you
shall do afterwards.</p>
<p>King Beder made all possible acknowledgments to
old Abdallah, for the great obligations he had to him,
for defending him from the wiles of a pestilent sorceress
who sought to ruin him; and after some little
discourse, he took his leave of him and returned to
the palace. Upon his arrival, he understood that the
queen waited for him with great impatience in the
garden. He went to pay his respects to her, and she
no sooner perceived him, than she came in great haste
to meet him. My dear Beder! said she, it is said,
with a great deal of reason, that nothing moves more
the force and excess of love than absence from the
object beloved. I have had no quiet since I saw you,
and the minutes I have been separated from you have
seemed so many ages; nay, if you had staid ever so
little longer, I was preparing to come and fetch you
once more to my arms.</p>
<p>Madam, replied king Beder, I can assure your majesty
that I have not been under less disquiets on your
account; but I could not refuse to stay a little longer
than ordinary with an uncle who loves me so dearly,
and had not seen me for so long a while. He would
have kept me still longer, but I tore myself away from
him to come and pay my vows where they are so much
due. Of all the collations he prepared for me, I have
only brought away this cake, which I desire your majesty
to accept. King Beder had wrapped up one of
the two cakes in a handkerchief very neatly, took it
out, and presented it to the queen, saying, I beg your
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
majesty to accept of it, though it be so inconsiderable
a present.</p>
<p>I do accept of it with all my heart, replied the
queen, receiving it, and will eat it cheerfully for yours
and your good uncle&rsquo;s sake: but before I taste of it,
I desire you will eat a piece of mine, which I have
made for you during your absence. Fair queen, answered
king Beder, receiving it with great respect,
such hands as your majesty&rsquo;s can never make any thing
but what is excellent; and the favour hereby done me
will exact an eternal acknowledgment.</p>
<p>King Beder then substituted, in the place of the
queen&rsquo;s cake, the other which old Abdallah had given
him, and having broken off a piece, he put it to his
mouth, and cried, while he was eating, Ah! queen, I
never tasted any thing so charming in my life. They
being near a cascade, the sorceress seeing him swallow
one bit of the cake, and ready to eat another, she took
a little water in the palm of her hand, and throwing
it on the king&rsquo;s face, said, Wretch! quit that form of
a man thou bearest, and take that of a vile horse, lame
and blind.</p>
<p>These words not having the desired effect, the sorceress
was strangely surprised to find king Beder still
in the same form, and that he only started, being a
little frightened. Blushes came suddenly into her
cheeks; and as she saw that she had missed her aim,
Dear Beder, cries she, this is nothing, recover thyself;
I did not intend thee any harm; what I did, was only
to see what thou wouldst say. I should be the most
miserable and execrable of women, should I attempt
aught against thy tranquillity; I do not only say, after
all the oaths I made to the contrary, but even after
so many testimonies of love as I have given thee.</p>
<p>Puissant queen, replied king Beder, however well
satisfied I were, that what your majesty did was only
to divert yourself, yet I could not help being a little
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
frightened with the surprise. Also, what could hinder
me from being a little moved at the pronouncing of
such terrible words, as are capable of making so
strange a transformation? But, madam, continued he,
let us set aside this discourse; and since I have ate of
your cake, I desire you would do me the like favour
by tasting of mine.</p>
<p>Queen Labe, who could no better justify herself
than by putting this confidence in the king of Persia,
broke off a piece of his cake and ate it; which she
had no sooner done, than she appeared much troubled,
and remained, as it were, motionless. King Beder,
seeing his time, took water out of the same basin she
had done, and, throwing it in her face, cried, Abominable
sorceress! quit that form of a woman, and
be turned instantly into a mare.</p>
<p>The same instant queen Labe was transformed into
a very beautiful mare; and she was so concerned to
find herself in that condition, that she shed tears in
great abundance, which perhaps no mare before had
been ever known to do. She bowed her head with
great obeisance to king Beder, thinking to move him
to compassion; but, though he could have been so
moved, it was absolutely out of his power to repair
the damage he had done her. He led her then into
the stable belonging to the palace, and put her into
the hands of a groom, to bridle and saddle; but of
all the bridles he tried upon her, not one would fit
her. This made him cause two horses to be saddled,
one for the groom and the other for himself; and the
groom led the mare after him to old Abdallah&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Abdallah, seeing king Beder coming with the mare
at a distance, doubted not but he had done what he
advised him. Cursed sorceress! said he immediately
to himself very joyfully. Heaven has at length punished
thee as thou deservest. King Beder alighted at
Abdallah&rsquo;s door, and entered with him into the shop
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
embracing and thanking him for all the signal services
he had done him. He related to him the whole matter,
with all its circumstances; and moreover told
him, he could find no bridle fit for the mare. Abdallah
found one that fitted exactly; and as soon as king
Beder had sent back the groom, he said to him, My
lord, you have no reason to stay any longer in this
city; take the mare, mount her, and return to your
kingdom. I have but one thing more to recommend to
you; and that is, if ever you should happen to part
with the mare, be sure to deliver her bridle. King
Beder promised to observe all his commands, and this
especially; and so, having taken leave of the good old
man, he departed.</p>
<p>The young king of Persia no sooner got out of the
city, than he began to reflect on the deliverance he had
had, and to rejoice he had the sorceress in his power,
who had given him so much cause to tremble. Three
days after, he arrived at a great city, where, entering
the suburbs, he met a venerable old man, walking on
foot towards a pleasure-house he had hard by: Sir,
said the old man to him, stopping, may I presume to
ask from what part of the world you come? The king
stopped to satisfy him; and, as they were discoursing
together, an old woman chanced to come by, who,
stopping likewise, wept and sighed bitterly at the
sight of the mare.</p>
<p>King Beder and the old man left off discoursing, to
look on the old woman, whom the king asked, whom
she had to lament so much. Alas! sir, replied she,
It is because your mare resembles so perfectly one my
son had, and which I still mourn the loss of on this
account, and should think yours were the same, did
I not know she was dead. Sell her to me, sir, I beseech
you, and I will give you even more than she is
worth, for the sake of the person that once owned her
likeness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>Good woman, replied king Beder, I am heartily
sorry I cannot comply with your request; my mare is
not to be sold. Alas! sir, continued the old woman,
do not refuse me this favour, for the love of God. I
conjure you to do it out of pure charity, since my son
and I shall certainly die with grief if you do not grant
it. Good mother, replied the king, I would grant it
with all my heart, if I was disposed to part with so
good a beast; but if I were so disposed, I believe
you would hardly give a thousand pieces of gold for
her, which is the lowest price I shall ever put upon
her. Why should I not give so much? replied the
old woman: if that be the lowest price, you need only
say you will take it, and I will fetch you the money.</p>
<p>King Beder, seeing the old woman so poorly dressed,
could not imagine she could find the money;
therefore, to try her, he said, not thinking to part
with his mare for all that, Go fetch me the money, and
the mare is yours. The old woman immediately unloosed
a purse she had fastened to her girdle, and desiring
him to alight, bade him tell over the money:
and, in case he found it came short of the sum demanded,
her house was not far off, and she could
quickly fetch the rest.</p>
<p>The surprise king Beder was in at the sight of this
purse was not small. Good woman, said he, do you
not perceive I have bantered you all this while? I
will assure you my mare is not to be sold.</p>
<p>The old man, who had been witness to all that was
said, now began to speak: Son, quoth he to king
Beder, it is necessary you should know one thing,
which I find you are ignorant of; and that is, that in
this city it is not permitted any one to lie, on any account
whatsoever, and that on pain of death: now,
you having made this bargain with this old woman,
you must not refuse her money, and delivering your
mare according to the agreement; and this you had
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
better do without any noise, than expose yourself to
what may ensue.</p>
<p>King Beder, sorely afflicted to find himself thus
trapped by his rash proffer, was nevertheless forced
to alight and perform his agreement. The old woman
stood ready to seize the bridle; which when she had
done, she immediately unbridled the mare, and taking
some water in her hand from a spring that ran in
the middle of the street, she threw it in the mare&rsquo;s
face, uttering these words: Daughter, quit that bestial
form, and reassume thy own. The transformation
was effected in a moment; and king Beder, who
swooned as soon as he saw queen Labe appear, would
have fallen to the ground, if the old man had not hindered
him.</p>
<p>The old woman, who was mother to queen Labe,
and who had instructed her in all her magic, had no
sooner embraced her daughter, than in an instant, she,
by whistling, caused a genie to rise, of a gigantic form
and stature: this genie immediately took king Beder
on one shoulder, and the old woman with the magic
queen on the other, and transported them in a few
minutes to the palace of queen Labe, in the city of
enchantments.</p>
<p>The magic queen immediately fell upon king Beder,
reproaching him grievously, in the following manner:
Is it thus, ungrateful wretch, that thy unworthy uncle
and thou make me amends for all the kindnesses I
have done for you? I shall soon be able to make you
both feel what you so well deserve. She said no more,
but, taking water in her hand, threw it in his face,
with these words, Come out of that form, and take
that of a vile owl. These words were soon followed
by the effect; and immediately she commanded one of
her women to shut up the owl in a cage, and give him
neither meat nor drink.</p>
<p>The woman took the cage, and, without regarding
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
what the queen ordered, gave him both meat and drink;
and being old Abdallah&rsquo;s friend, she sent him word
privately how the queen had treated his nephew, and
what design she had taken to destroy him and king
Beder, in case he did not take timely measures to
prevent it.</p>
<p>Abdallah knew no common measures would do with
queen Labe; he therefore did but whistle after a certain
manner, and there immediately rose a vast giant,
with four wings, who presented himself before him,
and asked what he would have with him. Lightning,
said Abdallah to him, (for so was the genie&rsquo;s name,)
I command you to preserve the life of king Beder, son
of the queen Gulnare. Go to the palace of the magic
queen, and transport immediately to the capital of
Persia the compassionate woman who has the cage in
custody, that she may inform queen Gulnare of the
danger the king her son is in, and the occasion he has
of her assistance. Take care not to fright her when
you come before her, and acquaint her from me what
she ought to do.</p>
<p>Lightning immediately disappeared, and got in an
instant to the palace of the magic queen. He instructed
the woman, lifted her up into the air, and
transported her to the capital of Persia, where he
placed her on the terrace of the apartment where
queen Gulnare was. She went down stairs to the
apartment, and she there found queen Gulnare and
queen Farasche, lamenting their mutual misfortunes.
She made them a profound reverence, and, by the
relation she gave them, they soon came to understand
the great necessity king Beder was in of their assistance.</p>
<p>Queen Gulnare was so overjoyed at the news, that,
rising from her seat, she went and embraced the good
woman, telling her how much she was obliged to her
for the service she had done her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>Then going immediately out, she commanded the
trumpets to sound and the drums to beat, to acquaint
the city, that the king of Persia would suddenly return
safe to his kingdom. She then went again, and found
king Saleh her brother, whom Farasche had caused
to come speedily thither, by a certain fumigation.
Brother, said she to him, the king your nephew, and
my dear son, is in the city of enchantments, under the
power of queen Labe. Both you and I must see what
we can do to deliver him, for there is no time to be
lost.</p>
<p>King Saleh forthwith assembled a puissant body of
sea-troops, and even called to his assistance the genies
his allies, who appeared with a much more numerous
army. As soon as the two armies were joined, he
put himself at the head of them, together with queen
Farasche, queen Gulnare, and the princesses, who
would all have their share in this glorious action.
They then lifted themselves up into the air, and soon
poured down on the palace and city of enchantments,
where the magic queen, her mother, and all the other
adorers of fire, were destroyed in an instant.</p>
<p>Queen Gulnare had ordered the woman who brought
her the news of queen Labe&rsquo;s transforming and imprisoning
her son, to follow her close, and bade her, in
her hurly-burly, to take no other care than to go and
seize the cage, and bring it to her. She did as she
was ordered, and queen Gulnare was no sooner in the
possession of the cage, than she opened it, and took
the owl out, saying, after she had sprinkled a little
water upon him, My dear son, quit that foreign form
which has been given thee, and resume thy natural
one of a man. In a moment queen Gulnare no more
saw the hideous owl, but king Beder her son instead
of him. She immediately embraced him with that
excess of joy which is better expressed by actions than
words. She could not find in her heart to let him
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
go; and, if he had not been in a manner torn from
her by queen Farasche, who had a mind to embrace
him in her turn, for aught I know, they might not have
parted till now, so great queen Gulnare&rsquo;s affection
was for him. After the queen his grandmother had
done with him, he was likewise embraced by the king
his uncle, and the princesses his relations.</p>
<p>The next care queen Gulnare had, was to look out
for old Abdallah, to whom she had been obliged for
the recovery of the king of Persia; and who, being
brought to her, she said to him, My obligations to you,
sir, have been so great, that there is nothing within
my power but I will freely do for you as a token of
my acknowledgment. Do but satisfy me in what I
can serve you; and you shall see I will immediately
set about it. Great queen, replied Abdallah, if the
lady next to your majesty will but consent to the marriage
I offer her, and the king of Persia will give me
leave to reside at his court, I will spend the remainder
of my days in his service. The queen turned towards
the lady; and, finding by her modesty that she
was not against the match proposed, she caused them
to join hands, and the king of Persia and she took
care of their fortune.</p>
<p>This marriage occasioned the king of Persia to
speak thus, addressing himself to the queen: Madam,
I am heartily glad of this match which your majesty
has just now made: there remains one more, which
I desire you to think of. Queen Gulnare did not at
first comprehend what marriage he meant; but, after
a little considering, she said, Of yours do you mean,
son? I consent to it with all my heart. Then, turning
about, and looking on her brother&rsquo;s sea-attendants,
and the genies, who were still present, she said, Go
you, and traverse both the sea and land, to find out
the most lovely and amiable princess, worthy of the
king my son, and come and bring us word.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>Madam, replied king Beder, it is to no purpose for
them to take all that pains. You have, no doubt,
heard that I have already given my heart to the princess
of Samarcand, upon the bare relation of her beauty.
I have seen her, and do not repent of the present I
then made her. In a word, neither earth nor sea, in
my opinion, can furnish a princess any thing like her.
It is true, upon declaring my love to her, she used me
after a rate that would have extinguished any flame
less fierce than mine: but I hold her excused; for,
after a rigorous treatment, and imprisoning the king
her father, which I was in some measure the cause of,
how could she use me more civilly? But, it may be,
the king of Samarcand may have changed his resolution;
and his daughter, the princess, may consent to
love me, when she sees her father has agreed to it.</p>
<p>Son, replied queen Gulnare, if only the princess
Giahaure can make you happy in this world, I shall
not make it my business to oppose you. The king
your uncle need only have the king of Samarcand
brought, and we shall see whether he be still of the
same untractable temper.</p>
<p>How strictly soever the king of Samarcand had been
kept during his captivity, by king Saleh&rsquo;s orders, yet
he always had great respect shown him, and was become
very familiar with the officers that guarded him.
In order to bring him, king Saleh caused a chafing
dish of coals to be brought, into which he threw a
certain composition, uttering at the same time some
mysterious words. As soon as the smoke began to
arise, the palace shook, and immediately the king of
Samarcand, with king Saleh&rsquo;s officers, appeared. The
king of Persia cast himself at the king of Samarcand&rsquo;s
feet; and then, rising upon one knee, he said, It is no
longer king Saleh that demands of your majesty the
honour of your alliance for the king of Persia: it is
the king of Persia himself that humbly begs that boon;
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
and I persuade myself your majesty will never persist
in being the cause of the death of a king, who can no
longer live than he is in the possession of the adorable
princess Giahaure.</p>
<p>The king of Samarcand did not long suffer the king
of Persia to remain on his knee; he took him up, and
embracing him, said, I should be very sorry to have
contributed in the least towards the death of a monarch
who is so worthy to live. If it be true that so
precious a life cannot be preserved, without being in
possession of my daughter, live, sir, and live happy;
she is yours. She has always hitherto been obedient
to my will, and I cannot think she will now oppose it.
Speaking these words, he ordered one of the officers
that king Saleh had assigned him, to go and look for
the princess Giahaure, and bring her to him immediately.</p>
<p>The princess continued all this while where the
king of Persia had left her. The officer brought her
with her women to attend her. The king of Samarcand
embraced her, and said, Daughter, I have provided
a husband for you: it is the king of Persia you
see there, the most accomplished monarch at this
juncture in the universe. The preference he has
given you to all other princesses obliges us both to
make him suitable acknowledgments.</p>
<p>Sir, replied the princess Giahaure, your majesty
well knows I have never presumed to disobey your
will in any thing: I shall be always ready to obey
you; and I hope the king of Persia will please to
forget the ill treatment I gave him, and consider it
was duty, not inclination, that forced me to it.</p>
<p>The nuptials were celebrated in the palace of the
city of enchantments, with so much the greater solemnity,
as all the lovers of the magic queen, who
resumed their pristine forms as soon as ever that queen
ceased to live, assisted at them, and came to pay their
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
acknowledgments to the king of Persia, queen Gulnare,
and king Saleh. They were all either sons of
kings, or princes of extraordinary merit.</p>
<p>King Saleh at length conducted the king of Samarcand
to his dominions, and put him once again in
possession of them. The king of Persia, having what
he most desired, returned to his capital with queen
Giahaure, queen Gulnare, queen Farasche, and the
princesses; and queen Farasche and the princesses
continued there, till such time as king Saleh came
to re-conduct them to his kingdom under the waves
of the sea.</p>

<h2 id="c3"><br />THE STORY OF
<br />GANEM, SON TO ABOU AYOUB, AND KNOWN BY THE SURNAME OF LOVE&rsquo;S SLAVE.</h2>
<p>There was formerly a merchant at Damascus,
who had, by care and industry, acquired great wealth,
on which he lived in a very honourable manner. His
name was Abou Ayoub, and he had one son and a
daughter. The son was at first called Ganem, but
afterwards had the surname of Love&rsquo;s Slave. He
was graceful as to his person, and the excellent natural
qualities of his mind had been improved by
able masters his father had taken care to provide
him. The daughter&rsquo;s name was Alcolomb, signifying
ravisher of hearts, because her beauty was so accomplished,
that whosoever saw her could not but
love her.</p>
<p>Abou Ayoub died, and left immense riches: an
hundred loads of brocades, and other silks that lay in
his warehouse, were the least part of it. The loads
were ready made up, and on every bale was written,
in large characters, &ldquo;For Bagdad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mohammed, the son of Soliman, surnamed Zinebi,
reigned at that time in Damascus, the capital of Syria.
His kinsman Haroun Alraschid, whose residence was
at Bagdad, had bestowed this kingdom on him as
tributary to him.</p>
<p>Soon after the death of Abou Ayoub, Ganem, discoursing
with his mother about their private affairs,
among the rest, concerning the bales of merchandise
that lay in the warehouse, asked her the meaning of
what was written upon each bale. My son, answered
his mother, your father used to travel sometimes into
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
one province and sometimes into another, and it was
customary with him, before he set out, to write the
name of the city he designed to repair to on every
bale. He had provided all things to take a journey
to Bagdad, and was upon the point of setting forwards,
when death&mdash;&mdash;She had not the power to
proceed any farther; the lively remembrance of the
loss of her husband would not permit her to say any
more, and drew from her a shower of tears.</p>
<p>Ganem could not see his mother so sensibly affected
without relenting. Thus they continued some
time in silence; but at length he recovered himself;
and, as soon as he found his mother calm enough to
listen to him, he directed his discourse to her, and
said: Since my father designed these goods for Bagdad,
and is no longer in being to put his design in
execution, I will prepare myself to perform that journey;
and I am of opinion, it will be proper for me to
expedite my departure, for fear those commodities
should perish, or, at least, that we lose the opportunity
of selling them to the best advantage.</p>
<p>Abou Ayoub&rsquo;s widow, who tenderly loved her son,
was much surprised at this resolution; and replied,
My dear child, I cannot but commend you for designing
to follow your father&rsquo;s example; but consider that
you are too young, inexperienced, and altogether a
stranger to the toils of travelling. Besides, can you
think of leaving me, and by that means add to that
sorrow with which I am already oppressed? Is it not
better to sell those goods to the merchants of Damascus,
and to take up with a moderate profit, than
to expose yourself to the danger of perishing?</p>
<p>It was in vain for her to oppose Ganem&rsquo;s resolution
by the strongest arguments, for they had no
weight with him. An inclination to travel, and to
accomplish himself by a thorough knowledge of the
affairs of the world, urged him on to set out, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
prevailed above all his mother&rsquo;s remonstrances, her
entreaties, and even her tears. He went away to the
market where the slaves are sold, and bought such as
were able of body, hired one hundred camels, and,
having furnished all other necessaries, he entered
upon his journey, with five or six merchants of Damascus,
who were going to trade at Bagdad.</p>
<p>Those merchants, attended by all their slaves, and
accompanied by several other travellers, made up
such a considerable caravan, that they had no occasion
to fear the Bedouins, that is, the Arabs who
make it their only profession to range the country,
and to attack and plunder the caravans which are not
strong enough to repulse them. Thus they had no
other difficulty to encounter than the usual fatigues of
a long journey, which were easily forgot when they
saw the city of Bagdad, where they arrived in safety.</p>
<p>They went to alight at the most magnificent and
most resorted khan in the city; but Ganem, who had
a mind to be lodged conveniently, and by himself,
took no apartment there. He only left his goods in
a warehouse for their greater security, and hired a
very fine house in the neighbourhood, richly furnished;
having a garden, which was very delightful,
on account of the many water-works and shady groves
that were in it.</p>
<p>Some days after this young merchant had been
settled in his house, and perfectly recovered of the
fatigue of his journey, he dressed himself genteelly,
and repaired to the public place where the merchants
meet to buy and sell their commodities, with a slave
following him, carrying a parcel of fine stuffs and
silks.</p>
<p>The merchants received Ganem very courteously,
and their syndic, or chief, to whom he first made application,
bought all his parcel at the price set down
in the ticket annexed to every piece of stuff. Ganem
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
continued his trade so successfully, that he daily sold
all the goods he exposed.</p>
<p>He had no more left than one bale, which he had
caused to be carried from the warehouse to his own
house, and then went to the public rendezvous, where
he found all the shops shut. This seemed somewhat
extraordinary to him; and, having asked the cause
of it, was told, that one of the prime merchants, whom
he knew, was dead, and that all his brother traders
were gone to his funeral.</p>
<p>Ganem inquired after the mosque where the ceremony
was to be performed, and whence the body was
to be conducted to the grave; and having been told
it, sent back his slaves with the goods, and walked
towards the mosque. He got thither before the prayers
were ended, which were said in a hall hung with
black satin. The corpse was taken up and followed
by the kindred, the merchants, and Ganem, to the
place of burial, which was at a great distance without
the city. It was a stone structure, like a dome, purposely
built to receive the bodies of all the family
of the deceased, and, being very small, they had
pitched tents all about it, that all the company might
be sheltered during the ceremony. The monument
was opened, and the corpse laid into it, after which
it was shut up again. Then the iman, and other ministers
of the mosque, sat down in a ring on carpets,
in the largest tent, and said the rest of the prayers.
They also read the chapters of the Alcoran appointed
for the burial of the dead. The kindred and merchants
sat round in the same manner behind the ministers.</p>
<p>It was near night before the whole was ended.
Ganem, who had not expected such a long ceremony,
began to be uneasy; and was the more so, when he
saw meat served up in memory of the deceased, according
to the custom of Bagdad. He was also told
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
that the tents had been set up, not only against the
heat of the sun, but also against the evening dew,
because they should not return to the city before the
next morning. These words perplexed Ganem: I
am a stranger, said he to himself, and have the reputation
of being a rich merchant: thieves may take
this opportunity of my absence, and go rob my house:
my very slaves may be tempted to make their advantage
of so convenient a time; they may run away
with all the gold I have received for my goods; and
whither shall I look for them? His head being full
of these thoughts, he ate a few mouthfuls hastily, and
dexterously slipped away from the company.</p>
<p>He made all possible haste to gain time; but, as
it often happens, the more a man puts on, the less he
advances: he mistook his way, and went astray in
the dark; so that it was near midnight when he
came to the city-gate; and, to add to this misfortune,
that was shut. That disappointment was a
fresh affliction to him; and he was obliged to think
of finding some convenient place to pass the rest of
the night in, and wait till the gate was opened. He
went into a burial-place, so very spacious, that it
reached from the city to the very place he was come
from. He advanced to a parcel of pretty high walls,
which enclosed a small field, being the peculiar burying-place
of a family, and in which there was a palm-tree.
There was an infinite number of other particular
burial-places, the doors whereof they did not
take much care to shut fast. Ganem, finding that
this burial-place was open, went into it, and put to
the door after him. He lay down on the grass, and
did all he could to sleep; but the uneasiness he was
under, for being absent from home, would not permit
him. He got up; and, after having passed by the
door several times, as he walked forwards and backwards,
he opened it, without knowing why he did so,
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
and immediately perceived a light at a distance,
which seemed to come towards him. He was startled
at that sight, put to the door, which had nothing
to make it fast but a latch, and got up as fast as
he could to the top of the palm-tree, looking upon
that as the safest retreat under his present apprehensions.
No sooner was he got up, than, by the
help of the light which had frightened him, he plainly
perceived three men, whom, by their habit, he knew
to be slaves, come into the burial-place. One of
them went foremost with a lantern, and the two
others followed him, being loaded with a chest, between
five and six feet long, which they carried on
their shoulders. They laid it down, and then one of the
three slaves said to his comrades, Brothers, if you will
be advised by me, we will leave the chest here, and
return to the city. No, no, replied another, that is
not the way of doing what we were ordered by our
mistress; we may have cause to repent our not
doing as we were commanded: let us bury the chest,
since we are so enjoined to do. The two other
slaves complied with him; so they began to break
ground with the tools they had brought for that purpose.
When they had made a deep trench, they
put the chest into it, and covered it with the earth
they had taken out; then departed, and returned
home.</p>
<p>Ganem, who, from the top of the palm-tree, had
heard every word the slaves had spoken, could not
tell what to think of that adventure. He concluded
that chest must needs contain something of value,
and that the person to whom it belonged had some
particular reasons for causing it to be buried in that
church-yard. He resolved immediately to satisfy
his curiosity, came down from the palm-tree, his fear
being gone with the slaves, and fell to work upon the
pit, plying his hands and feet so well, that in a short
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
time he discovered the chest, but found it secured
with a great padlock. This new obstacle to the satisfying
of his curiosity was no small mortification to
him: yet he would not be discouraged; but the day
beginning then to appear, he saw several great pebbles
about the burial-place: he picked out one, with
which he easily knocked off the padlock, and then,
with much impatience, opened the chest. Ganem
was strangely surprised, when, instead of finding money
in it, he discovered a young lady of incomparable
beauty. Her fresh and rosy complexion, and her
gentle regular breathing, satisfied him that she was
alive; but he could not conceive, why, if she were
only asleep, she had not awaked at the noise he made
in forcing off the padlock. Her habit was so costly,
with bracelets and pendants of diamonds, and a
necklace of true pearl, and so large, that he made not
the least doubt of her being one of the prime ladies
about the court. At the sight of so beautiful an object,
not only natural inclination to relieve persons in
danger, but also something more powerful, which
Ganem could not then give an account of, prevailed
on him to afford that young beauty all the assistance
he was able.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smaller">Drawn by R. Westall R.A. Engraved by Chas. Heath.</span></p>
</div>
<p>He first shut the gate of the burial-place, which
the slaves had left open, then returning, took the
lady in his arms out of the chest, and laid her on the
soft earth he had thrown off the chest. As soon as
the lady was laid down, and had the benefit of the
open air, she sneezed; and having made a motion in
turning her head there came from her mouth a
liquor, which seemed to have been offensive to her
stomach; then opening and rubbing her eyes, she,
with such a voice as charmed Ganem, whom she did
not see, cried out, Zohorob Bostan, Schragrom Matglon,
Cassabos Soucear, Nouron Nihar, Nagmatos
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
Sobi, Nour Hatos Zoman, why do you not answer?
where are you? Those were the names of six female
slaves that used to wait on her, and signified, Flower
of the Garden, Branch of Coral, Sugar Cane, Light
of the Day, Morning Star, and Delight of the Season.
She called them, and wondered that nobody
answered; but at length looking about, and perceiving
she was in a burial-place, she was in a mighty
fright. How now, cried she, much louder than before,
is this the resurrection of the dead? Is the day
of judgment come? What a wonderful change is this
from night to morning!</p>
<p>Ganem did not think fit to leave the lady any
longer in that confusion, but immediately appeared
before her with all possible respect; and, in the most
courteous manner, said, Madam, I am scarce able to
express my joy, for having happened to be here to do
you the service I have done, and for being present to
offer you all the assistance you shall stand in need of,
under your present circumstances.</p>
<p>In order to persuade the lady to repose all her
confidence in him, he, in the first place, told her who
he was, and what accident it was that had brought
him into that place. Next, he acquainted her with
the coming of the three slaves, and how they had
buried the chest. The lady, who had covered her face
with her veil as soon as Ganem appeared, was extraordinarily
sensible of the obligations she owed him.
I return thanks to God, said she, for having sent so
worthy a person as you are to deliver me from death;
but, since you have begun so charitable a work, I
conjure you not to leave it imperfect. Let me beg
of you to go into the city, and provide a muleteer to
come with his mule, and carry me to your house in
the chest; for, should I go in with you on foot, my
dress being different from that of the city-ladies,
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
some one might happen to take notice of it, and follow
me, which it highly concerns me to prevent.
When I shall be in your house, I will give you an
account of myself; and, in the mean time, be assured
that you have not obliged an ungrateful person.</p>
<p>Before the young merchant left the lady, he drew
the chest out of the pit, which he filled up with the
earth, laid her again in the chest, and shut it in such
a manner, that it did not look as if the padlock had
been forced off; but, for fear of stifling her, he put
it not quite close, leaving room for the air to get in.
Going out of the burial-place, he drew the door after
him; and the city-gate being then open, soon found
what he sought for. He returned with speed to the
burial-place, and helped the muleteer to lay the chest
across his mule; telling him, to remove all causes of
suspicion, that he came to that place the night before,
with another muleteer, who, being in haste to
return home, had laid down the chest in the burial-place.</p>
<p>Ganem, who had minded nothing but his business
since his arrival at Bagdad, was still unacquainted
with the power of love, and now felt the first sallies
of it. It had not been in his power to look upon the
young lady without being disturbed; and the uneasiness
he felt, following the muleteer at a distance,
and the fear lest any accident might happen by the
way that should deprive him of his conquest, taught
him to unravel his intricate thoughts. It was an
extraordinary satisfaction to him, when, being arrived
safe at home, he saw the chest unloaded. He
dismissed the muleteer; and having caused a slave
to shut the doors of his house, he opened the chest,
helped the lady out, gave her his hand, and conducted
her to his apartment, lamenting how much she
must have endured in that close confinement. If I
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
have suffered, said she, I have satisfaction enough in
what you have done me, and in the pleasure of seeing
myself out of danger.</p>
<p>Though Ganem&rsquo;s apartment was very richly furnished,
the lady did not so much regard that, as she
did the handsome presence and engaging mien of her
deliverer, whose politeness and obliging behaviour
highly heightened her gratitude. She sat down on a
sofa; and, to begin to give the merchant to understand
how sensible she was of the service done her,
she took off her veil. Ganem, on his part, was sensible
of the favour so lovely a lady did in uncovering
herself, or rather felt he had already a most violent
passion for her. Whatsoever obligations she owed
him, he thought himself more than requited by so singular
a favour.</p>
<p>The lady dived into Ganem&rsquo;s thoughts, yet was
not at all surprised, because he appeared very full of
respect. He, judging she might have occasion to
eat, and not willing to trust any but himself with the
care of entertaining so charming a guest, went out
with a slave to an eating-house to give directions for
a treat. From thence he went to a fruit-seller, where
he chose the finest and most excellent fruit; buying
also the choicest wine, and some of the same bread
that was eaten at the caliph&rsquo;s table.</p>
<p>As soon as he returned home, he, with his own
hands, made a pyramid of the fruit he had bought,
and served it up himself to the lady, in a large dish
of the finest china ware, saying, Madam, be pleased
to make choice of some of this fruit, while a more
solid entertainment, and more worthy yourself, is
made ready. He would fain have continued standing
before her; but she declared she would not
touch any thing, unless he sat down and ate with
her. He obeyed; and when they had eaten some
small matter, Ganem observing that the lady&rsquo;s veil,
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
which she had laid down by her on a sofa, was embroidered
along the edge with golden letters, begged
leave of her to look upon that embroidery. The lady
immediately took up the veil, and delivered it to
him, asking him whether he could read. Madam, replied
he, with a modest air, a merchant would be
able to manage his business very ill, if he could not
at least read and write. Well then, said she, read
the words which are embroidered on that veil,
which gives me an opportunity of telling you my
story.</p>
<p>Ganem took the veil, and read these words, &lsquo;I am
yours, and you are mine, thou descendant from the
prophet&rsquo;s uncle.&rsquo; That descendant from the prophet&rsquo;s
uncle was the caliph Haroun Alraschid, who
then reigned, and was descended from Abbas, Mahomet&rsquo;s
uncle.</p>
<p>When Ganem perceived the sense of these words,
Alas! madam, said he, in a melancholy tone, I have
just saved your life, and this embroidery is my death!
I do not comprehend all the mystery; but it makes
me too sensible that I am the most unfortunate of
men. Pardon the liberty I take, madam, of telling
you so much. It was impossible for me to see you
without giving you up my heart. You are not ignorant
yourself, that it was not in my power to refuse
it to you; and that makes my presumption excusable.
I proposed to myself to move yours by my
respect, my diligence, my complaisance, my assiduity,
my submission, and my constancy; and no
sooner had I flattered myself with that design, than
I am robbed of all my hopes. But be that as it will,
I shall have the satisfaction of dying entirely yours.
Proceed, madam, I conjure you, to give me a full information
of my unhappy state.</p>
<p>He could not deliver those words without letting
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
fall some tears. The lady was moved, but was so
far from being displeased at the declaration he made,
that she felt an inward joy, for her heart began to
yield. However, she concealed it; and, as if she
had not regarded what Ganem said, I would have
been very cautious, answered she, of showing you my
veil, had I thought it would have made you so uneasy;
and I do not perceive that what I have to say
to you can make your condition so deplorable as you
imagine.</p>
<p>You must understand, proceeded she, in order to
acquaint you with my story, that my name is Fetnah,
(which signifies a storm or tempest) which was given
me at my birth, because it was judged that the sight
of me would occasion many calamities. You cannot
be a stranger to it, since nobody in Bagdad but knows
that the caliph Haroun Alraschid, my sovereign lord
and yours, has a favourite so called.</p>
<p>I was carried into his palace in my very tender
years, and I have been brought up there with all the
care that is usually taken with such persons of my
sex as are designed to reside there. I made no ill
advances in all they took the pains to teach me; and
that, with some share of beauty, gained me the caliph&rsquo;s
affection, who gave me a particular apartment
adjoining to his own. That prince was not satisfied
with such a mark of distinction: he appointed twenty
women to wait on me, and as many eunuchs; and,
ever since, he has made me such considerable presents,
that I was once richer than any queen in the
world. You may reasonably judge, by what I have
said, that Zobeide, the caliph&rsquo;s wife and kinswoman,
could not but be jealous of my happiness. Though
Haroun has all the regard imaginable for her, she has
used all her endeavours to ruin me.</p>
<p>Hitherto, I had secured myself against all her
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
snares; but, at length, I fell under the last effort of
her jealousy; and, were it not for you, I had now
been exposed to inevitable death. I do not question
but that she had corrupted one of my slaves, who,
last night, in some lemonade, gave me a drug, which
causes such a deep sleep, that it is easy to dispose of
those who have taken it; and that sleep is so profound,
that nothing can dispel it for the space of
seven or eight hours. I have the more reason to
judge so, because naturally I am very light of sleep,
and apt to wake at the least noise.</p>
<p>Zobeide, the better to put her design in execution,
has laid hold of the opportunity of the absence of the
caliph, who has been gone lately to put himself at
the head of his troops, to chastise some neighbouring
kings, who have presumed to join in league to make
war on him. Were it not for this opportunity, my
rival, courageous as she is, durst not have presumed
to attempt any thing against my life. I know not
what she will do to conceal this action from the
caliph; but you see it highly concerns me that you
should keep my secret. My life depends on it. I
shall be safe in your house as long as the caliph is
from Bagdad. It behoves you to keep my adventure
private; for, should Zobeide know the obligation I
owe you, she would punish you for having saved me.</p>
<p>When the caliph returns, I shall not need to be so
much upon my guard. I shall find means to acquaint
him with all that has happened, and I am
fully persuaded he will be more earnest than myself
to requite a service which restores me to his
love.</p>
<p>As soon as Haroun Alraschid&rsquo;s beautiful favourite
had done speaking, Ganem began, and said, Madam,
I return you a thousand thanks for having given me
the information I took the liberty to desire of you;
and I beg of you to believe that you are here in
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
safety; the sentiments you have inspired in me are a
pledge of my secrecy.</p>
<p>As for my slaves, I own there is cause to suspect
them; they may perhaps fail of the fidelity they owe
me, should they know by what accident, and in what
place I had the good fortune to find you; but it is
impossible they should guess at that. Nay, I dare
assure you that they will not have the curiosity to
inquire after it. It is so natural for young men to
purchase beautiful slaves, that it will be no way surprising
to them to see you here, as believing you to
be one, and that I have bought you. They will also
believe that I had some particular reasons for bringing
you home as I did. Set your heart therefore at
rest as to that point, and remain satisfied that you
shall be served with all the respect that is due to the
favourite of so great a monarch as ours is. But how
great soever he is, give me leave, madam, to declare,
that nothing will be able to make me recall the present
I have made you of my heart. I know, and shall
never forget, that what belongs to the master is forbidden
to the slave; but I loved you before you told
me that you were engaged to the caliph: it is not in
my power to overcome a passion, which, though now
in its infancy, has all the force of a love strengthened
by a perfect correspondence. I wish your august
and most fortunate lover may revenge you against
the malice of Zobeide, by calling you back to him;
and, when you shall be restored to his wishes, that
you may remember the unfortunate Ganem, who is no
less your conquest than the caliph. As powerful as
that prince is, I flatter myself he will not be able to
blot me out of your memory. If love be your predominant
passion, he cannot love you more passionately
than I do; and I shall never cease to burn in your
flames, whatsoever part of the world I go into to
expire, after having lost you.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>Fetnah perceived that Ganem was under the greatest
of afflictions, and it moved her; but, considering
the uneasiness she was likely to bring upon herself
by prosecuting the discourse upon that subject, which
might insensibly lead her to discover the inclination
she felt in herself for him, she said, I perceive that
this sort of conversation gives you too much trouble;
let us change the discourse, and talk of the infinite
obligations I owe you. I can never sufficiently express
my satisfaction, when I consider that, without
your assistance, I had not beheld the light of the
sun.</p>
<p>It was happy for them both that somebody just
then knocked at the door: Ganem went to see who
it was, and found it was one of his slaves to acquaint
him that the entertainment was ready. Ganem, who,
by way of precaution, would have none of his slaves
to come into the room where Fetnah was, took what
was brought, and served it up himself to his beautiful
guest, whose soul was ravished to behold with
what diligence and respect he attended her.</p>
<p>When they had eaten, Ganem took away, as he
covered the table; and having delivered all things at
the chamber-door to his slaves, he said to Fetnah,
Madam, you may now perhaps desire to take some
rest; I will leave you, and when you have reposed
yourself you shall find me ready to receive your commands.</p>
<p>Having spoken these words, he left her, and went
to buy two women-slaves. He also bought two
parcels, the one of linen, and the other of all such
things as were proper to make up a toilet fit for the
caliph&rsquo;s favourite. Having conducted home the two
women-slaves, he presented them to Fetnah, saying,
Madam, a person of your quality cannot be without
two maids, at least, to serve you; be pleased to allow
me to give you these.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>Fetnah, admiring Ganem&rsquo;s forecast, My lord, said
she, I perceive you are not one that will do things
by halves: you add by your courtesy to the obligations
I owe you already; but I hope I shall not die
ungrateful, and that Heaven will soon put me in a
condition to make acknowledgments for all your acts
of generosity.</p>
<p>When the women-slaves were withdrawn into a
chamber adjoining, which the young merchant showed
them, he sat down on the sofa where Fetnah was;
but, at some distance from her, in token of the
greater respect. He then began again to discourse
of his passion, and spoke very moving things relating
to the invincible obstacles which robbed him of all
his hopes. I dare not so much as hope, said he, by
my passion, to excite the least sensibility in a heart
like yours, destined for the greatest prince in the
world. Alas! it would be a comfort to me, if I
could flatter myself that you have not looked upon
the excess of my love with indifferency. My lord,
answered Fetnah&mdash;Alas! madam, said Ganem, interrupting
her at the word lord, this is a second time
you have done me the honour to call me lord; the
presence of the women-slaves hindered me the first
time from taking notice of it to you: in the name of
God, madam, do not give me that title of honour; it
does not belong to me: treat me, I beseech you, as
your slave: I am, and shall never cease to be so.</p>
<p>No, no, replied Fetnah, interrupting him in her
turn, I shall be cautious how I treat a man to whom
I owe my life, after that manner. I should be ungrateful
could I say or do any thing that did not become
you. Leave me therefore to follow the dictates
of my gratitude, and do not require it of me that I
misbehave myself towards you, in return for the benefits
I have received. I shall never be guilty of it;
I am too sensible of your respectful behaviour, to
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
abuse it; and I will not stick to own, that I do not
look upon all your care with indifferency. You know
the reason that condemns me to silence.</p>
<p>Ganem was ravished at that declaration: he wept
for joy; and not being able to find expressions significant
enough, in his own conceit, to return Fetnah
thanks, was satisfied with telling her, that, as she
knew what she owed to the caliph, he, on his part,
was not ignorant, &lsquo;that what belongs to the master is
forbidden to the servant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Night drawing on, he went out to fetch some light,
which he brought in himself, as also some collation,
as is the custom in the city of Bagdad; where, having
made a good meal at noon, they, at night, are
satisfied with eating some fruit, and drinking a glass
of wine; so diverting the time till they go to bed.</p>
<p>They both sat down at table, and at first complimented
each other, presenting the fruit reciprocally.
The excellency of the wine insensibly drew them
both on to drink; and having drunk two or three
glasses, they agreed that neither should take another
glass without singing some air first. Ganem sang
verses he composed <i>extempore</i>, and which expressed
the vehemency of his passion; and Fetnah, encouraged
by his example, composed and sang verses relating
to her adventure, and always containing something
which Ganem might take in a sense that was
favourable to him; bating, that she nicely observed
the fidelity due to the caliph. The collation held till
very late, and the night was far advanced, before they
thought of parting. Ganem then withdrew to another
apartment, leaving Fetnah where she was, and the
women-slaves he had bought coming in to wait upon
her.</p>
<p>They lived together after this manner for several
days. The young merchant went not abroad, unless
upon business of the utmost consequence; and, even
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
for that, took the time when his lady was at her rest;
for he could not prevail upon himself to let slip a
moment that might be spent in her company. All
his thoughts were taken up with his dear Fetnah,
who, on her side, giving way to her inclination, confessed
she had no less affection for him than he had
for her. However, as fond as they were of each
other, their respect for the caliph kept them within
those bounds that were due to him, which still heightened
their passion.</p>
<p>While Fetnah, thus snatched from the jaws of
death, passed her time so agreeably with Ganem,
Zobeide was not without some apprehensions in Haroun
Alraschid&rsquo;s palace.</p>
<p>As soon as the three slaves intrusted with the
execution of her revenge, had carried away the chest,
without knowing what was in it, or so much as the
least curiosity to inquire into it, as being used to pay
a blind obedience to her commands, she was seized
with a tormenting uneasiness: a thousand perplexing
thoughts disturbed her rest; sleep fled from her
eyes, and she spent the night in contriving how to
conceal her crime. My consort, said she, loves Fetnah
more than ever he did any of his favourites.
What shall I say to him at his return, when he inquires
of me after her? Many contrivances occurred
to her, but none were satisfactory: she still met with
difficulties, and knew not where to fix. There lived
with her an ancient lady, who had bred her up from
her infancy: as soon as it was day, she sent for her,
and having intrusted her with the secret, said, Dear
mother, you have always been assisting to me with
your advice; if ever I stood in need of it, it is now;
when the business before you is to still my thoughts,
distracted by a mortal concern, and to show me some
way to satisfy the caliph.</p>
<p>Dear madam, replied the old lady, it had been
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
much better not to have run yourself into the difficulties
you labour under; but since the thing is done,
the best way is to say no more of it: all that must
now be thought of, is how to deceive the chief of believers;
and I am of opinion that you must immediately
cause a wooden image to be carved resembling
a dead body; we will shroud it up in old linen;
and, when shut up in a coffin, it shall be buried
in some part of the palace; then shall you immediately
cause a marble monument to be built, after
the manner of a dome, over the burial-place; and
erect a figure which shall be covered with black
cloth, and set about with great candlesticks and large
wax tapers. There is another thing, added the old
lady, which ought not to be forgot: you must put on
mourning, and cause the same to be done by all your
own and Fetnah&rsquo;s women, your eunuchs, and all that
belong to the palace. When the caliph returns, and
sees you and all the palace in mourning, he will be
sure to ask the occasion of it; then will you have an
opportunity of insinuating yourself into his favour,
saying, it was in respect to him, that you paid the
last honours to Fetnah, snatched away by sudden
death. You may also tell him you have caused a
mausoleum to be built; and, in short, that you have
paid all the dues to his favourite which he would have
done himself had he been present. His passion for
her being extraordinary, he will certainly go and shed
some tears upon her grave; and, perhaps, added the
old woman, he will not believe she is really dead;
and suspect you have turned her out of the palace
through jealousy, and look upon all the mourning as
an artifice to deceive him, and prevent his making
search after her. It is likely he will cause the coffin
to be taken up and opened, and it is certain he will
be convinced of her death as soon as he shall see the
figure of a dead body buried. He will be pleased
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
with all you shall have done, and express his gratitude.
As for the wooden image, I will undertake to
have it cut myself by a carver in the city, who shall
not know what use it is to be put to. As for your
part, madam, order Fetnah&rsquo;s woman, who yesterday
gave her the lemonade, to give out that she had just
found her mistress dead in her bed; and, that they
may only think of lamenting, without offering to go
into her chamber, let her add, she has already acquainted
you with it, and that you have ordered Mesrour
to cause her to be laid out and buried.</p>
<p>As soon as the old lady had spoken these words,
Zobeide took a rich diamond ring out of her casket,
and putting it on her finger, and embracing her in a
perfect transport of joy, said, How infinitely am I
beholden to you, my dear mother! I should never
have thought of so ingenious a contrivance. It cannot
fail of success, and I perceive my peace of mind
begins to be restored to me. I leave the care of the
wooden figure to you, and I will go myself to order
the rest.</p>
<p>The wooden image was got ready with as much
expedition as Zobeide could have wished, and then
conveyed by the lady herself into Fetnah&rsquo;s bed-chamber,
where she dressed it like a dead body, and put
it into a coffin. Then Mesrour, who was much deceived
by it, caused the coffin, and the representation
of Fetnah, to be carried away; and buried it with
the usual ceremonies, in the place appointed by Zobeide,
the favourite&rsquo;s women weeping and lamenting,
and she who had given her the lemonade setting them
an example by her cries and howlings.</p>
<p>That very day, Zobeide sent for the architect of
the palace, and of the caliph&rsquo;s other houses; and,
according to the orders he received from her, the
mausoleum was finished in a very short time. Such
potent princesses, as was this consort of a monarch,
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
whose power extended from east to west, are always
punctually obeyed in whatsoever they command, by
all the court; so that the news of Fetnah&rsquo;s death
was soon spread all over the town.</p>
<p>Ganem was one of the last who had heard of it;
for, as I have before observed, he scarce went abroad.
Being at length informed of it, Madam, said he to
the caliph&rsquo;s fair favourite, you are thought to be
dead in Bagdad, and I do not question but that Zobeide
herself believes it; I bless Heaven that I am
the cause, and the happy witness of your being
alive; and would to God, that, taking the advantage
of this false report, you would share my fortune, and
go far from hence to reign in my heart! But whither
does this pleasing notion carry me? I do not consider
that you are born to make the greatest prince in the
world happy, and that only Haroun Alraschid is
worthy of you. Supposing you could resolve to give
him up for me, and that you would follow me, ought I
to consent to it? No, it is my part always to remember,
that what belongs to the master is forbidden to
the slave.</p>
<p>The lovely Fetnah, though moved by the tenderness
of the passion he expressed, yet prevailed with
herself not to comply with it. My lord, said she to
him, we cannot obstruct Zobeide&rsquo;s triumphing. I am
not at all surprised at the artifice she makes use of to
conceal her guilt: but let her proceed; I flatter myself
that sorrow will soon follow her triumph: the
caliph will return, and we shall find means privately
to inform him of all that has happened. In the mean
time, let us be more cautious than ever, that she may
not know I am alive. I have already told you the
consequences.</p>
<p>Three months after, the caliph returned to Bagdad
with honour, having vanquished all his enemies: he
entered the palace with impatience to see Fetnah,
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
and to lay all his laurels at her feet; but was amazed
to see all the servants he had left behind him in
mourning. It struck him, without knowing the cause;
and his concern was double, when, coming into the
apartment of Zobeide, he spied that princess coming
to meet him with all her women in mourning. He
immediately asked her the cause of it, with much
concern. Chief of the believers, answered Zobeide,
I am in mourning for your slave Fetnah, who died so
suddenly, that it was impossible to apply any medicine
to her distemper. She would have proceeded,
but the caliph did not give her time, being so surprised
at the news, that he cried out, and then fell
into a swoon in the arms of Giafar, his grand vizier,
who attended him. Coming soon after to himself, he,
with a weak voice, which sufficiently expressed his
concern, asked where his dear Fetnah had been buried?
Sir, said Zobeide, I took care myself of her
funeral, and spared for no cost to make it magnificent.
I have caused a marble mausoleum to be built
over her grave, and will attend you thither, if you
desire it.</p>
<p>The caliph would not permit Zobeide to take that
trouble, but was satisfied to have Mesrour to conduct
him. He went thither just as he was, that is, in the
camp dress. When he saw the figure covered with
a black cloth, the lighted candles all about it, and the
magnificence of the mausoleum, he was amazed that
Zobeide should have performed the obsequies of her
rival with so much magnificence; and, being naturally
of a jealous temper, he suspected his wife&rsquo;s
generosity, and fancied his mistress might perhaps
be yet alive; that Zobeide, taking the advantage of
his long absence, might have turned her out of the
palace, ordering those she had intrusted with it to
convey her so far-off, that she might never more be
heard of. This was all he suspected; for he did not
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
think Zobeide wicked enough to have murdered his
favourite.</p>
<p>The better to discover the truth himself, that prince
ordered the figure to be removed, and caused the
grave and the coffin to be opened in his presence: but
when he saw the linen which wrapped up the wooden
image, he durst not proceed any farther. That religious
caliph thought it would be an irreligious act to
suffer the body of the dead lady to be touched; and
this scruple prevailed above his love and curiosity.
He caused the coffin to be shut up again, the grave
to be filled, and the figure to be placed as it was before.</p>
<p>The caliph, thinking himself obliged to pay some
respect to the tomb of his favourite, sent for the ministers
of his religion, the officers of the palace, and
the readers of the Alcoran; and, whilst they were
calling together, he remained in the mausoleum,
moistening the earth that covered the phantom of his
love with his tears. When all the persons he had sent
for were come, he stood before the figure, and they
about it recited long prayers; after which the readers
of the Alcoran read several chapters.</p>
<p>The same ceremony was performed every day during
the whole month, morning and evening, the caliph
being always present, with Giafar the grand vizier,
and the prime officers of the court, all of them in
mourning, as well as the caliph himself, who all that
while failed not to honour the memory of Fetnah with
tears, and would not talk the least of any business.</p>
<p>The last day of the month, the prayers and reading
of the Alcoran lasted from that morning till break of
day the next morning; and at length, when all was
done, every man returned home. Haroun Alraschid,
being tired with sitting up all that time, went to take
some rest in his apartment, and fell asleep on a sofa
between two of the court ladies, one of them sitting
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
at the bed&rsquo;s head, and the other at the feet, who,
whilst he slept, were working some embroidery, and
observed a profound silence.</p>
<p>She who sat at the bed&rsquo;s head, and whose name
was Nouron-Nihar, that is, Dawn of the Day, perceiving
the caliph was asleep, whispered to the other,
called Nagmatos-Sobi, signifying Morning-Star, There
is great news! The chief of the believers, our master,
will be overjoyed when he awakes and hears what I
have to say to him: Fetnah is not dead; she is in
perfect health. O Heavens! cried Morning-Star, in
a transport of joy, is it possible that the beautiful, the
charming, the incomparable Fetnah should be still
among the living? Morning-Star uttered these words
with such a sprightly air, and so loud, that the caliph
awaked. He asked why they had disturbed his rest.
Alas! my sovereign lord, answered Morning-Star,
pardon me this indiscretion, I could not contain myself.
What then is become of her, said the caliph, if
she is not dead? Chief of the believers, replied Dawn
of the Day, I this evening received a note, not signed,
from a person unknown, but written with Fetnah&rsquo;s
own hand, which gives me an account of her melancholy
adventures, and orders me to acquaint you with
it. I thought fit, before I fulfilled my commission,
to let you take some few moments&rsquo; rest, believing you
must stand in need of it after your fatigue. Give me
that note, said the caliph, interrupting her in a disorderly
manner; you were in the wrong in deferring
to deliver it to me.</p>
<p>Dawn of the Day immediately delivered him the
note, which he opened with much impatience; and in
it Fetnah gave a brief account of all that had befallen
her, but enlarged a little too much on the care Ganem
took of her. The caliph, who was naturally jealous,
instead of being provoked at the inhumanity of Zobeide,
was only concerned for the infidelity he fancied
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
Fetnah had been guilty of towards him. Is it so?
said he, after reading the note; the perfidious wretch
has been four months with a young merchant, and
has the impudence to boast of the respect he pays
her. Thirty days are passed since my return to Bagdad,
and she now bethinks herself of sending me this
news. Ungrateful creature! while I spend the days
in bewailing her, she passes them away in betraying
me. Go to, let us take revenge of the false woman,
and that bold youth who affronts me. Having spoken
these words, that prince got up, and went into a great
hall, where he used to appear in public, and to give
audience to the great men of his court. The first
gate was opened, and immediately all the courtiers,
who expected him, that moment entered. The grand
vizier came in, and prostrated himself before the
throne the caliph sat on. Then rising, he stood before
his master, who, in a tone which denoted he
would be instantly obeyed, said to him, Giafar, your
presence is requisite for putting in execution an important
affair I am about to commit to you. Take
four hundred men out of my guards along with you,
and first inquire where a merchant of Damascus lives,
whose name is Ganem, the son of Abou Ayoub. When
you have learned that, repair to his house, and cause
it to be razed down to the foundation; but first secure
Ganem, and bring him hither, with my slave Fetnah,
who has lived with him these four months. I will
punish her, and make an example of that insolent
man, who has presumed to fail in respect to me.</p>
<p>The grand vizier having received this positive command,
made a low bow to the caliph, having his hand
on his own head, as a token that he would rather lose
it than disobey him, and departed. The first thing
he did, was to send to the syndic, or head of the
merchants, for some foreign stuffs and fine silks, of
the new ones brought by Ganem; with strict orders,
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
above all things, to inquire after the street and house
he lived in. The officer he sent with these orders
brought him back word, that he had scarce been seen
for some months, and no man knew what could keep
him at home, if he was there. The same officer told
Giafar where Ganem lived, and the name of the widow
who had let him the house.</p>
<p>Upon this information, which could not fail, that
minister, without losing any time, marched with the
soldiers the caliph had ordered him to take, went to
the mayor of the city, whom he also caused to bear
him company; and being attended by a great number
of carpenters and masons, with the necessary tools
for razing of a house, came to that in which Ganem
lived; and finding it stood alone, without being confined
any way, he posted his soldiers quite round it,
to prevent the young merchant making his escape.</p>
<p>Fetnah and Ganem had just then dined: the lady
was sitting at a window next the street; and hearing
a noise, she looked out through the lattice, when, seeing
the grand vizier draw near with all his attendants,
she concluded his design was upon her as well as Ganem.
She perceived her note had been received, but had
not expected such an answer, having hoped that the
caliph would have taken that business quite otherwise.
She knew not how long that prince had been
come home; and though she was acquainted with his
jealous temper, yet she apprehended nothing on that
account. However, the sight of the grand vizier and
the soldiers made her quake in reality, not for herself,
but for Ganem: she did not question clearing herself,
provided the caliph would but hear her. As for Ganem,
whom she was kind to rather out of gratitude
than affection, she plainly foresaw that his rival, being
incensed, would see, and might be apt to condemn
him, upon account of his youth and mien. Being full
of that thought, she turned to the young merchant,
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
and said, Alas! Ganem, we are undone; it is you and
I that are sought after. He presently looked through
the lattice, and was seized with dread when he beheld
the caliph&rsquo;s guards with their naked scimitars, and
the grand vizier with the civil magistrate at the head
of them. At that sight he stood motionless, and had
not power to utter one word. Ganem, said the favourite,
there is no losing of time: if you love me,
put on the habit of one of your slaves immediately,
and daub your face and arms with soot; then lay
some of these dishes on your head: you may be taken
for a servant belonging to the eating-house, and they
will let you pass. If they happen to ask you where
the master of the house is, answer, without any hesitation,
that he is within. Alas! madam, answered
Ganem, less concerned for himself than for Fetnah,
you only take care of me; what will become of you?
Let not that trouble you, replied Fetnah, it is my part
to look to that. As for what you leave in this house,
I will take care of it; and I hope it will be one day
justly restored to you, when the caliph&rsquo;s anger is over:
but do you avoid his fury; for the orders he gives in
heat of passion are always fatal. The young merchant&rsquo;s
affliction was so great, that he knew not what
course to fix upon, and would certainly have suffered
himself to have been seized by the caliph&rsquo;s soldiers,
had not Fetnah pressed him to disguise himself. He
was prevailed upon by her persuasions, to put on the
habit of a slave, and daub himself with soot; and it
was high time, for they were knocking at the door;
and all they could do was to embrace each other lovingly:
they were both so overwhelmed with sorrow
that they could not utter one word; and it was thus
they parted. Ganem went out with some dishes on
his head: he was taken for the servant of an eating-house,
and nobody offered to stop him. On the contrary,
the grand vizier, who was the first that met him,
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
gave him way to let him pass, being far from any
thought that he was the man he looked for. Those
who were behind the grand vizier made way as he
had done, and thus favoured his escape. He got
speedily to one of the city gates, and so got clear
away.</p>
<p>While he was making the best of his way from the
grand vizier Giafar, that minister came into the room
where Fetnah was sitting on a sofa, and where there
were many chests full of Ganem&rsquo;s equipage, and of
the money he had made of his goods.</p>
<p>As soon as Fetnah saw the grand vizier come into
the room, she fell flat on her face, and continued in that
posture, as it were, ready to receive her death. My lord,
said she, I am ready to undergo the sentence passed
against me by the chief of the believers; you need
only make it known to me. Madam, answered Giafar,
falling also down till she had raised herself, God
forbid any man should presume to lay his profane
hands on you. I do not design to offer you the least
wrong. I have no farther orders than to entreat you
will be pleased to go with me to the palace, and to
conduct you thither with the merchant that lives in
this house. My lord, replied the favourite, let us go;
I am ready to follow you. As for the young merchant,
to whom I am indebted for my life, he is not here;
he has been gone about a month since to Damascus,
whither his business called him, and he has left these
chests you see under my care till he returns. I conjure
you to cause them to be secured, that I may
perform the promise I made to take all possible care
of them.</p>
<p>You shall be obeyed, said Giafar, and immediately
sent for porters, whom he commanded to take up the
chests, and carry them to Mesrour.</p>
<p>As soon as the porters were gone, he whispered
the civil magistrate, committing to him the care of
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
seeing the house razed; but first to cause diligent
search to be made for Ganem, who, he suspected,
might be hid, whatever Fetnah had told of him.
Then he went out, taking the young lady with him
attended by the two slaves that waited on her. As for
Ganem&rsquo;s slaves, they were not regarded; they ran in
among the crowd, and it was not known what became
of them.</p>
<p>No sooner was Giafar out of the house, than the
masons and carpenters began to raze it; and did it so
effectually, that in a few hours none of it remained.
But the civil magistrate, not finding Ganem, after the
strictest search, sent to acquaint the grand vizier with
it, before that minister reached the palace. Well,
said Haroun Alraschid, seeing him come into his
closet, have you executed my orders? Yes, sir, answered
Giafar, the house Ganem lived in is levelled
with the ground, and I have brought you your favourite
Fetnah; she is at your closet-door, and I will call her
in if you command me. As for the young merchant,
we could not find him, though all places have been
searched; and Fetnah affirms that he has been gone
this month to Damascus.</p>
<p>Never was any man in such a passion as the caliph,
when he heard that Ganem had made his escape.
As for his favourite, being possessed that she had
been false to him, he would neither see nor speak to
her. Mesrour, said he to the chief of the eunuchs,
who was there present, take the ungrateful, the perfidious
Fetnah, and go shut her up in the dark tower.
That tower was within the enclosure of the palace,
and commonly served as a prison for the favourites
who any way disgusted the caliph.</p>
<p>Mesrour, being used to execute his sovereign&rsquo;s
orders, though ever so unjust, without making any
objection, obeyed this with some reluctancy. He signified
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
his concern to Fetnah, who was the more
grieved at it, because she had reckoned that the
caliph would not refuse to speak to her. There was
no remedy but to submit to her hard fate, and to
follow Mesrour, who conducted her to the dark tower,
and there left her.</p>
<p>In the mean time the caliph, being incensed, and
only consulting his passion, wrote the following letter,
with his own hand, to the king of Syria, his cousin
and tributary, who resided at Damascus.</p>
<h3 title="">THE LETTER FROM THE CALIPH HAROUN ALRASCHID TO MOHAMMED ZINEBI, KING OF SYRIA.</h3>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="sc">Cousin</span>, this is to inform you, that a merchant
of Damascus, whose name is Ganem, the son of Abou
Ayoub, has seduced the most amiable of my women
slaves, called Fetnah, and is fled. It is my will, that,
when you have read my letter, you cause search to be
made for Ganem, and secure him. When he is in
your power, you shall cause him to be loaded with
irons, and for three days successively he shall receive
fifty strokes with a bull&rsquo;s pizzle. Then let him be led
through all parts of the city, with a crier, crying,
This is the smallest punishment the chief of the believers
inflicts on him that offends his lord, and debauches
one of his slaves. After that, you shall send
him to me under a strong guard. It is my will that
you cause his house to be plundered; and when it
shall be razed, order the materials to be carried out
of the city into the middle of the plain. Besides, if
he has father, mother, sister, wives, daughters, or
other kindred, cause them to be stripped; and when
they are naked, expose them as a spectacle during
three days to the whole city, forbidding any one, on
pain of death, to afford them any shelter. I expect
you will no way delay what I enjoin.</p>
<p><span class="jr"><span class="sc">Haroun Alraschid.</span>&rsquo;</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p class="tb">The caliph having written this letter, sent it away
by an express, ordering him to make all possible speed,
and to take pigeons along with him, that he might
the sooner hear what had been done by Mohammed
Zinebi.</p>
<p>The pigeons of Bagdad have this particular quality,
that, though they be carried ever so far, they return
to Bagdad as soon as they are turned loose, especially
when they have young ones. A letter rolled up is
made fast under their wing; and by that means, they
have speedy advice from such places as they desire.</p>
<p>The caliph&rsquo;s express travelling night and day, as
his master&rsquo;s impatience required, and being come to
Damascus, went directly to king Zinebi&rsquo;s palace, who
sat upon his throne to receive the caliph&rsquo;s letter. The
express having delivered it, Mohammed looking upon
it, and knowing the hand, stood up to show his respect,
kissed the letter, and laid it on his head, to
denote he was ready submissively to obey the orders
contained in it. He opened it, and having read it,
immediately descended from his throne, and, without
losing time, mounted on horseback, with the prime
officers of his household. He also sent for the civil
magistrate, who came to him; and then he went directly
to Ganem&rsquo;s house, attended by all his guards.</p>
<p>That young merchant&rsquo;s mother had never heard or
received any letter from him since he left Damascus,
but the other merchants with whom he went to Bagdad
were returned, and all of them told her they had
left her son in perfect health. However, as he did
not return himself, and neglected to write, the tender
mother could not be persuaded but that he was dead,
and was so fully convinced of it in her imagination,
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
that she went into mourning. She bewailed Ganem
as if she had seen him die, and had herself closed his
eyes: never mother expressed greater sorrow; and
so far was she from seeking any comfort, that she delighted
in indulging her sorrow. She caused a dome
to be built in the middle of the court belonging to her
house, in which she placed a figure representing her
son, and covered it with black cloth. She spent the
greatest part of the days and nights in weeping under
that dome, in the same manner as if her son had been
buried there. The beautiful Alcolomb, or Ravisher
of Hearts, her daughter, bore her company, and mixed
her tears with hers.</p>
<p>It was now some time since they had thus devoted
themselves to sorrow, and since the neighbourhood,
hearing their cries and lamentations, pitied such
loving relations, when king Mohammed Zinebi came
to the door, which, being opened by a slave belonging
to the family, he went into the house, inquiring for
Ganem, the son of Abou Ayoub.</p>
<p>Though the slave had never seen king Zinebi, she
easily guessed, by his retinue, that this must be one
of the prime men of Damascus. My lord, said she,
that Ganem you inquire for is dead: my mistress, his
mother, is in that monument you see there, actually
lamenting the loss of him. The king, not regarding
what was said by the slave, caused all the house to be
diligently searched by his guards for Ganem. Then
he advanced towards the monument, where he saw
the mother and daughter sitting on nothing but a mat,
by the figure which represented Ganem, and their
faces appeared to him bathed in tears. Those poor
women immediately veiled themselves, as soon as they
beheld a man at the door of the dome; but the mother,
knowing the king of Damascus, got up, and ran
to cast herself at his feet. My good lady, said he, I
was looking for your son Ganem; is he here? Alas,
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
sir! cried the mother, it is a long time since he has
ceased to be: would to God I had at least put him
into his shroud with my own hands, and had the comfort
of having his bones in this monument! O, my
son, my dear son! She would have said more, but
was oppressed with so violent sorrow that she was
not able.</p>
<p>Zinebi was moved; for he was a prince of a mild
nature, and had much compassion for the sufferings
of the unfortunate. If Ganem alone is guilty, thought
he to himself, why should the mother and the daughters,
who are innocent, be punished? Ah! cruel
Haroun Alraschid, what a mortification do you put
upon me, in making me the executioner of your vengeance,
obliging me to persecute those persons who
have not offended you!</p>
<p>The guards that the king ordered to search for
Ganem, came and told him they had lost their labour.
He was fully convinced: the tears of these two women
would not leave him any room to doubt. It distracted
him to be obliged to execute the caliph&rsquo;s order. My
good lady, said he to Ganem&rsquo;s mother, come out of
this monument with your daughter; it is no place
of safety for you. They went out; and he, to secure
them against any insult, took off his own robe, which
was very large, and covered them both with it, bidding
them be sure to keep close to him. Then he ordered
the multitude to be admitted to plunder, which was
performed with the utmost rapaciousness, and many
shouts, which terrified Ganem&rsquo;s mother and sister the
more, because they knew not the reason of it. The
rabble carried off the richest goods, chests full of
wealth, fine Persian and Indian carpets, cushions
made of cloth of gold and silver, fine china ware. In
short, all was taken away; nothing was left but the
hard walls of the house: and it was certainly a dismal
spectacle for the unhappy ladies, to see all their
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
goods plundered, without knowing why they were so
cruelly treated.</p>
<p>When the house was plundered, Mohammed ordered
the civil magistrates to raze the house and monument;
and, whilst that was doing, he carried away
Alcolomb and her mother to his palace. There it was
he redoubled their affliction, acquainting them with
the caliph&rsquo;s will. He commands me, said he to them,
to cause you to be stripped, and expose you naked for
three days to the view of the people. It is with the
utmost reluctance that I execute that cruel and ignominious
sentence. The king delivered these words
with such an air, as plainly made it appear his heart
was really pierced with grief and compassion. Though
the fear of being dethroned obstructed his following
the dictates of his pity, yet he in some measure moderated
the rigour of Haroun Alraschid&rsquo;s orders,
causing coarse sacks, like smocks with sleeves, to be
made of horse-hair, for Ganem&rsquo;s mother, and his sister
Alcolomb, or Ravisher of Hearts.</p>
<p>The next day, these two victims of the caliph&rsquo;s rage
were stripped of their clothes, and their horse-hair
smocks put upon them; their head-dress was also
taken away, so that their dishevelled hair hung upon
their backs. Alcolomb had the finest hair in the
world; and it hung down to the ground. In that condition,
they were exposed to the people. The civil
magistrate, attended by his officers, went along with
them; and they were conducted throughout all the
city. A crier went before them, who, every now and
then, cried, This is the punishment due to those who
have drawn on themselves the indignation of the chief
of the believers.</p>
<p>When they walked in this manner along the streets
of Damascus, with their arms and feet naked, clad in
such a strange garment, and endeavouring to hide
their shame under their hair, with which they covered
<span class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
their faces, all the people were dissolved in tears;
more especially the ladies, looking on them as innocent
persons, through their lattice-windows, and being
particularly moved by Alcolomb&rsquo;s youth and beauty,
made the air ring with their dreadful shrieks, as
they passed before their houses. The very children,
frightened at those shrieks, and at the spectacle that
occasioned them, mixed their cries with that general
lamentation, and added new horror to it. In short,
had an enemy been at Damascus, and then putting
all to fire and sword, the consternation could not have
been greater.</p>
<p>It was near night when that dismal scene concluded.
The mother and daughter were both conducted
back to king Mohammed&rsquo;s palace. Not being
used to walk barefoot, they were so spent, that they
lay a long time in a swoon. The queen of Damascus,
highly afflicted at their misfortunes, notwithstanding
the caliph&rsquo;s prohibition to relieve them, sent some of
her women to comfort them with all sorts of refreshments,
and wine to raise their spirits.</p>
<p>The queen&rsquo;s women found them still in a swoon,
and almost past receiving any benefit by what they
offered them. However, with much difficulty, they
were brought to themselves. Ganem&rsquo;s mother immediately
returned them thanks for their courtesy. My
good lady, said one of the queen&rsquo;s ladies to her, we
are highly concerned at your affliction; and the queen
of Syria, our mistress, has done us a favour in employing
us to assist you. We can assure you, that
princess is much afflicted at your misfortunes, as well
as the king her consort. Ganem&rsquo;s mother entreated
the queen&rsquo;s women to return her majesty a thousand
thanks from her and her daughter Alcolomb; and then,
directing her discourse to the lady that spoke to her,
she said, Madam, the king has not told me why the
chief of the believers inflicts so many outrages on us;
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
pray be pleased to tell us what crimes we have been
guilty of. My good lady, answered the other, the
origin of your misfortune proceeds from your son
Ganem. He is not dead, as you imagine. He is accused
of having stolen the beautiful Fetnah, the best
beloved of all the king&rsquo;s favourites; and he having,
by timely flight, withdrawn himself from that prince&rsquo;s
indignation, the punishment is fallen on you. All
mankind condemns the caliph&rsquo;s resentment; but all
mankind fears him: and you see king Zinebi himself
dares not contradict his orders, for fear of incurring
his displeasure. So that all we can do is to pity and
exhort you to have patience.</p>
<p>I know my son, answered Ganem&rsquo;s mother; I have
educated him very carefully, and in that respect which
is due to the commander of the believers. He has
not committed the crime he is accused of; I dare answer
for his innocency. But I will give over muttering
and complaining, since it is for him that I suffer,
and he is not dead. O Ganem! added she, in a
transport of love and joy, my dear son Ganem, is it
possible that you are still alive? I no longer am concerned
for the loss of my goods; and how extravagant
soever the caliph&rsquo;s orders may be, I forgive him
all the severity of them, provided Heaven has saved
my son. I am only concerned for my daughter; her
sufferings only afflict me; yet I believe her to be so
good a sister as to follow my example.</p>
<p>At the hearing of these words, Alcolomb, who till
then had appeared insensible, turned to her mother,
and, clasping her arms about her neck, Yes, dear
mother, said she, I will always follow your example,
whatever extremity the love of my brother brings you
to.</p>
<p>The mother and daughter, thus interchanging their
sighs and tears, continued a considerable time in such
moving embraces. In the mean time, the queen&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
women, who were much moved at that spectacle,
omitted no persuasions to prevail with Ganem&rsquo;s mother
to take some sustenance. She ate a morsel out
of complaisance, and Alcolomb did the like.</p>
<p>The caliph having ordered that Ganem&rsquo;s kindred
should be exposed three days successively to the sight
of the people, in the condition as has been said, Alcolomb
and her mother afforded the same spectacle
the second time next day, from morning till night.
But that day and the following, things were not done
after the same manner: the streets, which at first had
been full of people, were left quite empty. All the
traders, incensed at the ill usage of Abou Ayoub&rsquo;s
widow and daughter, shut up their shops, and kept
themselves close within their houses. The ladies, instead
of looking through their lattice-windows, withdrew
into the back parts of their houses. There was
not one soul to be seen in the public places those unfortunate
women were carried through. It looked as
if all the inhabitants of Damascus had abandoned
their city.</p>
<p>On the fourth day, king Mohammed Zinebi, who
was resolved punctually to obey the caliph&rsquo;s orders,
though he did not approve of them, sent criers into
all quarters of the city to make proclamation, strictly
forbidding all the inhabitants of Damascus, and
strangers, of what condition soever, upon pain of
death, and having their bodies cast to the dogs to be
devoured, to receive Ganem&rsquo;s mother and sister into
their houses, or to give them a morsel of bread or a
drop of water; and, in a word, to afford them the
least support, or hold the least correspondence with
them.</p>
<p>When the criers had performed what the king had
enjoined them, that prince ordered the mother and
the daughter to be turned out of the palace, and left
to their choice to go where they thought fit. As soon
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
as ever they appeared, all persons fled from them, so
great an impression had the late prohibition made
upon them all. They easily perceived that every body
shunned them; but not knowing the reason of it, they
were much surprised; and their amazement was the
greater, when, coming into any street, or among several
persons, they knew some of their best friends,
who presently vanished with as much haste as the rest.
What is the meaning of this? said Ganem&rsquo;s mother:
do we carry the plague about us? Must the unjust
and barbarous usage we have received render us
odious to our fellow-citizens? Come, my child, added
she, let us depart from Damascus with all speed; let
us not stay any longer in a city where we are become
frightful to our very friends.</p>
<p>The two wretched ladies, discoursing after this
manner, came to one of the ends of the city, and retired
to a ruined house, to pass the night. Thither
some Mussulmen, or believers, out of charity and
compassion, resorted to them after the day was shut
in. They carried them provisions, but durst not stay
to comfort them, for fear of being discovered, and
punished for disobeying the caliph&rsquo;s orders.</p>
<p>In the mean time, king Zinebi had let fly a pigeon,
to give Haroun Alraschid an account of his exact
obedience. He informed him of all that had been
done, and conjured him to direct what he would have
done with Ganem&rsquo;s mother and sister. He soon received
the caliph&rsquo;s answer the same way, which was,
that he banished them from Damascus for ever. Immediately
the king of Syria sent men to the old house,
with orders to take the mother and the daughter, and
to conduct them three days&rsquo; journey from Damascus,
and there to leave them, forbidding them ever to return
to the city.</p>
<p>Zinebi&rsquo;s men executed their commission; but
being less precise than their master, in the strict performance
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
of every tittle of Haroun Alraschid&rsquo;s orders,
they in pity gave Alcolomb and her mother some small
pieces of money to buy them some subsistence, and
each of them a bag, which they hung about their
necks, to carry their provisions.</p>
<p>In this miserable condition, they came to the first
village. The peasants flocked about them; and as
it appeared through their disguise that they were
people of some fashion, they asked them what was
the occasion of their travelling after that manner, in
a habit that did not seem properly to belong to them.
Instead of answering the question put to them, they
fell a-weeping, which only served to heighten the
curiosity of the peasants, and to move them to compassion.
Ganem&rsquo;s mother told them what she and her
daughter had endured; at which the good countrywomen
were sensibly afflicted, and endeavoured to
comfort them. They treated them as well as their
poverty would permit; they took off their horse-hair
smocks, which were very uneasy, and put on others
they gave them, with shoes, and something to cover
their heads, and save their hair.</p>
<p>Having expressed their gratitude to those charitable
women, Alcolomb and her mother departed that village,
taking short journeys towards Aleppo. They
used at night to lie near the mosques, or in them,
upon the mat, if there was any, or else on the bare
pavement; and sometimes put up in the places appointed
for the use of travellers. As for sustenance,
they did not want; for they often came to places
where bread, boiled rice, and other provisions, are
distributed to all travellers who desire it.</p>
<p>At length they came to Aleppo, but would not stay
there, and holding on their journey towards the Euphrates,
crossed that river, and entered into Mesopotamia,
which they traversed as far as Moussoul.
Thence, notwithstanding all they had endured, they
<span class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
proceeded to Bagdad. That was the place they had
fixed their thoughts upon, hoping to find Ganem there,
though they ought not to have fancied that he was in
a city where the caliph resided: but they hoped, because
they wished it; their affection rather increasing
than diminishing, in spite of all their misfortunes.
Their discourse was generally about him, and they
inquired for him of all they met. But let us leave
Alcolomb and her mother, to return to Fetnah.</p>
<p>She was still confined close in the dark tower, ever
since the day that had been so fatal to Ganem and
her. However, disagreeable as her prison was to her,
it was much less grievous than the thoughts of Ganem&rsquo;s
misfortune, the uncertainty of whose fate was
a killing affliction to her. There was scarce a moment
in which she did not lament him.</p>
<p>One night when the caliph was walking by himself
within the enclosure of his palace, as he frequently
did; for he was the most prying prince in the world,
and sometimes, by means of those night-walks, he
came to the knowledge of things that happened in his
palace, which would otherwise never have come to his
ear: one of these nights, in his walk, he happened to
pass by the dark tower, and fancying he heard somebody
talk, he stopped, and drew near the door to listen,
and distinctly heard these words, which Fetnah,
whose thoughts were always on Ganem, uttered with
a loud voice: O Ganem! too unfortunate Ganem!
where are you at this time? whither has thy cruel
fate led thee? Alas! it is I that have made you miserable!
Why did you not let me perish unhappily,
rather than afford me your generous relief? What a
dismal reward have you received for your care and
respect! The commander of the faithful, who ought
to have requited, persecutes you; and in return for
having always looked upon me as a person reserved
for his bed, you lose all your goods, and are obliged
<span class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
to seek for safety in flight. O caliph! barbarous caliph!
what will you say for yourself when you shall
appear with Ganem before the tribunal of the Supreme
Judge, and the angels shall testify the truth before
your face! All the power you are now invested with,
and which makes the best part of the world quake,
will not prevent your being condemned and punished
for your violent and unjust proceedings. Here Fetnah
ceased her complaint, her sighs and tears putting
a stop to her tongue.</p>
<p>This was enough to bring the caliph to himself.
He plainly perceived, that if what he had heard was
true, his favourite must be innocent, and that he had
been too rash in giving orders against Ganem and his
family. Being resolved to be rightly informed in an
affair which so nearly concerned him, in point of
equity, on which he valued himself, he immediately
returned to his apartment, and that moment ordered
Mesrour to repair to the dark tower and bring Fetnah
to him.</p>
<p>By this command, and much more by the caliph&rsquo;s
way of delivery, the chief of the eunuchs guessed that
his master designed to pardon his favourite, and take
her to him again. He was overjoyed at it, for he
loved Fetnah, and had been much concerned at her
disgrace; and therefore flying to the tower, Madam,
said he to the favourite, with such an air as expressed
his satisfaction, be pleased to follow me: I hope you
will never more return to this vile dark tower: the
commander of the faithful has a mind to speak with
you, and I have reason to hope for a happy issue.</p>
<p>Fetnah followed Mesrour, who conducted her into
the caliph&rsquo;s closet. She prostrated herself before that
prince, and so continued, letting fall a shower of tears.
Fetnah, said the caliph, without bidding her rise, I
think you charge me with violence and injustice.
Who is he, who, notwithstanding the regard and respect
<span class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
he had for me, is in a miserable condition?
Speak freely; you know how good-natured I am, and
that I love to do justice.</p>
<p>By these words the favourite conceived that the caliph
had heard what she had said; and laying hold on
so favourable an opportunity to clear her dear Ganem,
she said, Commander of the true believers, if I have
let fall any word that is not agreeable to your majesty,
I most humbly beseech you to forgive me; but
he whose innocence and misfortune you desire to be
acquainted with, is Ganem, the unhappy son of Abou
Ayoub, merchant in Damascus. He is the man that
saved my life, and afforded me a safe sanctuary in his
house. I must own, that, from the first moment he
saw me, he perhaps designed to devote himself to me,
and conceived hopes of engaging me to admit of his
service. I guessed at this, by the eagerness he showed
in entertaining, and giving me all the attendance
which was requisite under the circumstances I was
then in; but as soon as he heard that I had the honour
to belong to you, Alas, madam, said he, &lsquo;That
which belongs to the master is forbidden to the
slave.&rsquo; From that moment, I owe this justice to his
virtue, his behaviour was always suitable to his
words. However, you well know with what rigour
you have treated him, and you will answer for it before
the tribunal of God.</p>
<p>The caliph was not displeased with Fetnah for the
freedom of those words. But may I, answered he,
rely on the assurances you give me of Ganem&rsquo;s virtue?
Yes, replied Fetnah, you may; I would not for
the world conceal the truth from you: and to make
out to you that I am sincere, I must own one thing to
you, which perhaps may displease you; but I beg pardon
of your majesty beforehand. Speak, child, said
Haroun Alraschid; I forgive all, provided you conceal
nothing from me. Well then, replied Fetnah, let
<span class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
me inform you, that Ganem&rsquo;s respectful behaviour,
together with all the good offices he did me, gained
him my esteem. I went farther yet: you know the
tyranny of love; I felt some tender inclination growing
in my breast. He perceived it, but was still far
from taking an advantage of my frailty: and notwithstanding
the flame which consumed him, he still remained
steady in his duty; and all his passion could
force from him, were those words I have already told
your majesty, &lsquo;That which belongs to the master is
forbidden to the slave.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This ingenuous confession might have provoked any
other man than the caliph; but it was the very thing
which quite appeased that prince. He commanded
her to rise, and making her sit by him, Tell me your
story, said he, from the beginning to the end. She
did so with much art and wit, slightly passing over
what regarded Zobeide, and dilating on the obligations
she owed Ganem, the expense he had been at
for her; and, above all, she highly extolled his discretion,
endeavouring by that means to make the caliph
sensible that she had been under the necessity of
lying concealed in Ganem&rsquo;s house, to deceive Zobeide.
She concluded with the young merchant&rsquo;s escape,
which she plainly told the caliph she had compelled
him to, that he might avoid his indignation.</p>
<p>When she had done speaking, the caliph said to
her, I believe all you have told me; but why was it so
long before you let me hear from you? Was there any
need of staying a whole month after my return, before
you sent me word where you were? Commander of
the true believers, answered Fetnah, Ganem went
abroad so very seldom, that you need not wonder that
we were none of the first that heard of your return.
Besides that, Ganem, who took upon him to deliver
the letter I wrote to Nouron Nihar, was a long time
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
before he could find an opportunity of putting it into
her own hands.</p>
<p>It is enough, Fetnah, replied the caliph; I own my
fault, and would willingly make amends for it by
heaping favours on that young merchant of Damascus;
therefore consider what I can do for him: ask what
you think fit, and I will grant it. Hereupon the
favourite fell down at the caliph&rsquo;s feet, with her face
flat on the ground; and then rising again, said, Commander
of the true believers, after returning your majesty
thanks for Ganem, I most humbly entreat you
to cause it to be published throughout all your dominions,
that you pardon the son of Abou Ayoub, and
that he may safely come to you. I will do more, rejoined
that prince, in requital for having saved your
life, and the respect he has bore to me, and to make
amends for the loss of his goods; and, in short, to repair
the wrong I have done to his family, I give him
to you for a husband. Fetnah had not words expressive
enough to thank the caliph for his generosity.
She then withdrew into the apartment she had before
her dismal adventure. The same furniture was still
in it; nothing had been removed; but that which
pleased her most, was, to find there Ganem&rsquo;s chests
and packs, which Mesrour had taken care to convey
thither.</p>
<p>The next day Haroun Alraschid ordered the grand
vizier to cause proclamation to be made throughout
all his dominions, that he pardoned the son of Abou
Ayoub; but this proved of no effect, for a long time
elapsed without any news of that young merchant.
Fetnah concluded for certain, that he had not been
able to survive the pain of losing her. A dreadful
uneasiness seized her; but as hope is the last thing
which forsakes lovers, she entreated the caliph to
give her leave to seek for Ganem herself; which being
<span class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
granted, she took a purse with a thousand pieces
of gold out of her basket, and one morning went out
of the palace, mounted on a mule she had out of the
caliph&rsquo;s stables, very richly accoutred. Black eunuchs
attended her, with their hands on each side upon the
mule&rsquo;s buttocks.</p>
<p>Thus she went from mosque to mosque, bestowing
her alms among the devotees of the Mahometan religion,
desiring their prayers for obtaining the accomplishment
of an affair on which the happiness of two
persons, as she told them, depended. She spent the
whole day and the thousand pieces of gold, in giving
alms at the mosques, and returned to the palace in
the evening.</p>
<p>The next day she took another purse of the same
value, and, in the like equipage as the day before,
went to the place where all the jewellers&rsquo; shops were;
and stopping at the door without alighting, sent one
of her black eunuchs for the syndic, or chief of them.
That syndic, who was an extraordinary charitable man,
and spent above two-thirds of his income in relieving
poor strangers, whether they happened to be sick or
in distress, made not Fetnah stay, knowing by her
dress that she was a lady belonging to the palace. I
apply myself to you, said she, putting the purse into
his hands, as a person whose piety is cried up throughout
the city. I desire you to distribute that gold
among the poor strangers you relieve, for I know you
make it your business to assist poor strangers who
have recourse to your charity. I am also satisfied that
you prevent their wants, and that nothing is more
agreeable to you than to have an opportunity of
easing their misery. Madam, answered the syndic,
I shall obey your commands with pleasure; but if you
desire to exercise your charity in person, and will be
pleased to step to my house, you will there see two
women worthy of your compassion: I met them yesterday
<span class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
as they were coming into the city; they were
in a deplorable condition, and it moved me the more,
because I thought they were persons of some quality.
Through all the rags that covered them, and notwithstanding
the impression the sun has made on their
faces, I discovered a noble air, not to be commonly
found in those poor people I relieve. I carried them
both to my house, and delivered them to my wife,
who was of the same opinion with me. She caused
her slaves to provide them good beds, whilst she herself
washed their faces, and gave them clean linen.
We know not as yet who they are, because we will
let them take some rest before we trouble them with
our questions.</p>
<p>Fetnah, without being able to give any reason for
it, had a curiosity to see them. The syndic would
have conducted her to his house, but she would not
give him the trouble, and was satisfied that a slave of
his should go and show her the way. She alighted at
the door, and followed the syndic&rsquo;s slave, who was
gone on before to give notice to his mistress, she being
then in the chamber with Alcolomb and her mother,
for they were the persons the syndic had been
talking of to Fetnah.</p>
<p>The syndic&rsquo;s wife, being informed by the slave that
a court-lady was in her house, was going out of the
room to meet her; but Fetnah, who had followed
close to the slave&rsquo;s heels, did not give her so much
time, and coming into the chamber, the syndic&rsquo;s wife
fell down before her, to express the respect she had
for all that belonged to the caliph. Fetnah took her
up, and said, My good lady, I desire you would let
me speak with those two strangers that arrived at
Bagdad last night. Madam, answered the syndic&rsquo;s
wife, they lie in those two little beds you see close by
each other. The favourite immediately drew near
the mother&rsquo;s, and viewing her carefully, Good woman,
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
said she, I come to offer you my assistance: I have
a considerable interest in this city, and may be assisting
to you and your companion. Madam, answered
Ganem&rsquo;s mother, I perceive by your obliging offers
that Heaven has not quite forsaken us, though we
have cause to believe it, after so many misfortunes as
have befallen us. Having uttered these words, she
wept so bitterly that Fetnah and the syndic&rsquo;s wife
could not forbear letting fall some tears.</p>
<p>The caliph&rsquo;s favourite, having dried up hers, said to
Ganem&rsquo;s mother, Be so kind as to tell us your misfortunes,
and recount your story. You cannot give the
relation to any persons better disposed than we are
to use all possible means to comfort you. Madam,
replied Abou Ayoub&rsquo;s disconsolate widow, a favourite
of the commander of the true believers, a lady whose
name is Fetnah, is the occasion of all our misfortunes.
These words were like a thunderbolt to the favourite:
but suppressing her concern and uneasiness,
she suffered Ganem&rsquo;s mother to proceed, who did it
after this manner: I am the widow of Abou Ayoub, a
merchant of Damascus; I had a son, called Ganem,
who, coming to trade at Bagdad, has been accused of
having debauched that Fetnah. The caliph has caused
search to be made for him every where, to put him to
death; and not finding him, wrote to the king of
Damascus, to cause our house to be plundered and
razed, and to expose my daughter and me three days
successively, stark naked, to be seen by the people,
and then to banish us out of Syria for ever.</p>
<p>But how unworthy soever our usage has been, I
should still be comforted, were my son alive, and I
could meet with him. What a pleasure would it be
for his sister and me to see him again! Embracing
him, we should forget the loss of our goods, and all
the evils we have suffered for him. Alas! I am fully
persuaded he is the innocent cause of them; and that
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
he is no more guilty towards the caliph, than his
sister and I.</p>
<p>No doubt of it, said Fetnah, interrupting her there;
he is no more guilty than you are; I can assure you
of his innocence, for I am that very Fetnah you so
much complain of, who, through some fatality in my
stars, have occasioned so many misfortunes. To me
you must impute the loss of your son, if he is no
more; but if I have occasioned your misfortune, I
can in some measure relieve it. I have already
cleared Ganem to the caliph, who has caused it to be
proclaimed throughout his dominions, that he pardons
the son of Abou Ayoub; and I do not question
but that he will do you as much good as he has done
you harm. You are no longer his enemies: he expects
Ganem to requite the service he has done me by
uniting our fortunes: he gives me to him for his consort;
therefore look on me as your daughter, and permit
me to vow an eternal friendship to you. Having
so said, she bowed down on Ganem&rsquo;s mother, who
was so astonished that she could return no answer.
Fetnah held her a long time in her arms, and only left
her to run to the other bed to Alcolomb, who, sitting
up, held out her arms to receive her.</p>
<p>When the caliph&rsquo;s charming favourite had given
the mother and daughter all the tokens of affection
they could expect from Ganem&rsquo;s wife, she said to
them, Cease both of you to afflict yourselves: the
wealth Ganem had in this city is not lost; it is in my
apartment in the palace; but I know all the treasure
in the world cannot comfort you without Ganem: I
judge so of his mother and sister, if I may judge of
them by myself; blood is no less powerful than love
in great minds. But why should we despair of seeing
him again? We shall find him: the good fortune of
meeting with you makes me conceive fresh hopes:
and perhaps this is the last day of your sufferings, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
the beginning of a greater felicity than you enjoyed
in Damascus when Ganem was with you.</p>
<p>Fetnah would have gone on, when the syndic of the
jewellers came in, saying, Madam, I am come from
seeing a very moving object; it is a young man, a camel-driver,
who was carrying to the hospital of Bagdad:
he was bound with cords on a camel, because
he had not strength enough to sit him. They had
already unbound, and were carrying him into the
hospital, when I happened to be passing by. I went
close up to the young man, viewed him carefully, and
fancied his countenance was not altogether unknown
to me. I asked him some questions concerning his
family and his country; but all the answer I could
get, consisted only in sighs and tears. I took pity
on him, and perceiving, by being so much used to
sick people, that he had great need to have particular
care taken of him, I would not permit him to be
put into the hospital; for I am too well acquainted
with their way of looking to the sick, and am sensible
of the incapacity of the physicians. I have caused
him to be brought home to my house by my slaves;
and they are now, by my orders, putting on some of
my own linen, and serving him as they would do me,
in a chamber for that purpose.</p>
<p>Fetnah&rsquo;s heart leaped at these words of the jeweller,
and she felt a sudden emotion, for which she
could not account. Show me, said she to the syndic,
into that sick man&rsquo;s room; I would gladly see him.
The syndic conducted her, and whilst she was going
thither, Ganem&rsquo;s mother said to Alcolomb, Alas!
daughter, as wretched as that sick stranger is, your
brother, if he be living, is not perhaps in a more happy
condition.</p>
<p>The caliph&rsquo;s favourite, coming into the chamber
where the sick man was, drew near the bed, into
which the syndic&rsquo;s slaves had already laid him. She
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
saw a young man whose eyes were closed, his countenance
pale, disfigured, and bathed in tears. She
gazed earnestly on him, her heart beat, and she fancied
she beheld Ganem; but yet she would not believe
her eyes. Though she found something of Ganem
in the object she beheld, yet, in other respects,
he appeared so different, that she durst not imagine
it was he that lay before her. However, not being
able to withstand the earnest desire of being satisfied,
Ganem, said she, with a quivering voice, is it
you I behold? Having spoken these words, she
stopped to give the young man time to answer; but
observing that he seemed insensible, Alas! Ganem,
added she, it is not you that I talk to! My imagination
being overcharged with your image, has given
this stranger a deceitful resemblance: the son of
Abou Ayoub, though ever so sick, would know the
voice of Fetnah. At the name of Fetnah, Ganem
(for it was really he) opened his eyes, and turned his
face towards the person that spoke to him, and
knowing the caliph&rsquo;s favourite, Ah! madam, said
he, what miracle?&mdash;&mdash;He could say no more; such
a sudden transport of joy seized him that he fell into
a swoon. Fetnah and the syndic did all they could
to bring him to himself; but as soon as they perceived
he began to revive, the syndic desired the lady
to withdraw, for fear lest the sight of her should
heighten Ganem&rsquo;s distemper.</p>
<p>The young man, having recovered his senses, looked
all about, and not seeing what he looked for, cried
out, What is become of you, charming Fetnah? did
you really appear before mine eyes, or was it only an
illusion? No, sir, said the syndic, it was no illusion.
It was I that caused that lady to withdraw, but you
shall see her again as soon as you are in a condition
to bear her sight. You now stand in need of rest,
and nothing ought to obstruct your taking it. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
posture of your affairs is altered, since you are, as I
suppose, that Ganem, in favour of whom the commander
of the true believers has caused a proclamation
to be made in Bagdad, declaring that he forgives
him what is past. Be satisfied for the present, with
knowing so much; the lady who just now spoke to
you will acquaint you with the rest; therefore think
of nothing but recovering your health: I will contribute
all that shall be in my power towards it. Having
spoken these words, he left Ganem to take his
rest, and went himself to provide all such medicines
for him as were proper to recover his strength, quite
spent by want and toil.</p>
<p>During that time Fetnah was in the room with
Alcolomb and her mother, where almost the same
scene was acted over again; for when Ganem&rsquo;s mother
understood that the sick man the syndic had
then newly brought into his house was Ganem himself,
she was so overjoyed, that she also swooned
away; and when, with the assistance of Fetnah and
the syndic&rsquo;s wife, she was again come to herself, she
would have got up to see her son: but the syndic
coming in then, hindered her, giving her to understand
that Ganem was so weak and feeble that it
would endanger his life, to excite in him those commotions
which must be the consequence of the unexpected
sight of a beloved mother and sister. There
was no occasion for the syndic&rsquo;s making any long discourses
to persuade Ganem&rsquo;s mother: as soon as she
was told that she could not discourse to her son without
hazarding his life, she ceased insisting to go and
see him. Then Fetnah, turning the discourse, said,
Let us bless Heaven for having brought us all together
into one place. I will return to the palace to
give the caliph an account of all these adventures,
and to-morrow morning I will return to you: this
said, she embraced the mother and the daughter, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
went away. As soon as she came to the palace, she
sent Mesrour to desire to be admitted to the caliph
in private, which was immediately granted; and being
brought into that prince&rsquo;s closet, where he was
alone, she prostrated herself at his feet, with her
face on the ground, according to custom. He commanded
her to rise, and having made her sit down,
asked whether she had heard any news of Ganem.
Commander of the true believers, said she, I have
been so successful, that I have found him, as also his
mother and sister. The caliph was curious to know
how she could find them in so short a time, and she
satisfied his curiosity, saying so many things in commendation
of Ganem&rsquo;s mother and sister, that he
desired to see them, as well as the young merchant.</p>
<p>Though Haroun Alraschid was passionate, and in
his heat sometimes guilty of cruel actions; yet, to
make amends, he was just, and the most generous
prince in the world, as soon as his anger was over,
and he was made sensible of the wrong he had done.
Therefore, having no longer cause to doubt but that
he had unjustly persecuted Ganem and his family,
and having publicly wronged them, he resolved to
make them public satisfaction. I am overjoyed, said
he to Fetnah, that your search has proved so successful;
it is a mighty satisfaction to me, not so
much for your sake as for my own. I will keep the
promise I have made you. You shall marry Ganem,
and I here declare you are no longer my slave. Go
back to that young merchant; and, as soon as he has
recovered his health, you shall bring him to me, with
his mother and sister.</p>
<p>The next morning early, Fetnah repaired to the
syndic of the jewellers, being impatient to hear of
Ganem&rsquo;s health, and to tell the mother and daughter
the good news she had for them. The first person
<span class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
she met was the syndic, who told her that Ganem had
rested very well that night; and that his distemper
altogether proceeded from melancholy, and the cause
being removed, he would soon recover his health.</p>
<p>Accordingly the son of Abou Ayoub was much
mended. Rest, and the good medicines applied to
him, but, above all, the easiness of his mind, had
wrought so good an effect, that the syndic thought
he might without danger see his mother, his sister,
and his mistress, provided he was prepared to receive
them; because there was ground to fear that, not
knowing his mother and sister were at Bagdad, the
sight of them might occasion too great joy and surprise.
It was therefore resolved, that Fetnah should
first go alone into Ganem&rsquo;s chamber, and then make a
sign to the two other ladies to appear, when she
thought fit.</p>
<p>Affairs being so ordered, the sick man was acquainted
with Fetnah&rsquo;s coming, by the syndic, which
was so ravishing a sight to him, that he was again
near falling into a swoon. Well, Ganem, said she,
drawing near to his bed, you have again found your
Fetnah, whom you thought you had lost for ever.
Ah! madam, said he, interrupting her, what miracle
has restored you to my sight? I thought you were in
the caliph&rsquo;s palace: that prince has doubtless given
ear to you. You have dispelled his jealousy, and he
has restored you to his favour. Yes, my dear Ganem,
answered Fetnah, I have cleared myself before
the commander of the true believers, who, to make
amends for the wrong he has done you, bestows me
on you for a wife. These last words occasioned such
an excess of joy in Ganem, that he knew not for a
while how to express himself, otherwise than by that
passionate silence so well known to lovers. At length
he broke out with these words: Ah, beautiful Fetnah,
may I give credit to what you tell me? May I
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
believe that the caliph really resigns you to Abou
Ayoub&rsquo;s son? Nothing is more certain, answered the
lady. That prince, who before caused search to be
made for you to take away your life, and who in his
fury caused your mother and your sister to suffer a
thousand indignities, desires now to see you, that he
may reward the respect you had for him; and there
is no question to be made, but that he will be profuse
in his favours to your family.</p>
<p>Ganem asked what the caliph had done to his mother
and sister, which Fetnah told him; and he could
not forbear letting fall some tears at that relation,
notwithstanding his thoughts were so full of the
news he had heard of being married to his mistress.
But when Fetnah informed him that they were actually
in Bagdad, and in the same house with him, he
appeared so impatient to see them, that the favourite
could no longer defer giving him that satisfaction;
and accordingly called them in. They were then at
the door, only waiting that moment. They came in,
made up to Ganem, and embracing him in their
turns, gave him a thousand kisses. How many tears
were shed amidst those embraces! Ganem&rsquo;s face
was bathed with them, as well as his mother&rsquo;s and
sister&rsquo;s; and Fetnah let fall in abundance. The
syndic himself, and his wife, being moved at the
spectacle, could not forbear weeping, nor sufficiently
admire the secret workings of Providence, which
brought together into their house four persons whom
fortune had so cruelly parted.</p>
<p>When they had all dried up their tears, Ganem
drew a fresh supply, by the recital of all he had suffered
from the day he left Fetnah, till the moment
the syndic brought him to his house. He told them,
that having reached a small village, he there fell
sick; that some charitable peasants had taken care
of him, but finding he did not recover, a camel-driver
<span class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
had undertaken to carry him to the hospital at Bagdad.
Fetnah, also, told them all the uneasiness of
her imprisonment; how the caliph, having heard her
talk in the tower, had sent for her into his closet,
and how she had cleared herself. In the conclusion,
when they had all related what accidents had befallen
them, Fetnah said, Let us bless Heaven, which has
brought us all together again, and let us think of nothing
but the happiness that attends us. As soon
as Ganem has recovered his health, he must appear
before the caliph with his mother and sister; but because
they are not in a condition to be seen, I will go
and make some provision for them; so I desire you
to stay a moment for me.</p>
<p>This said, she went away to the palace, and soon returned
to the syndic&rsquo;s, with a purse containing a thousand
pieces of gold, which she delivered to the syndic,
desiring him to buy clothes for the mother and
daughter. The syndic, who was a man of a good
fancy, chose such as were extraordinary fine, and had
them made up with all speed. They were finished
in three days, and Ganem, finding himself strong
enough to go abroad, prepared for it; but on the day
he had appointed to go and pay his respects to the
caliph, when he was making ready with his mother
and sister, the grand vizier Giafar came to the syndic&rsquo;s
house.</p>
<p>That minister came on horseback, attended by a
great number of officers. Sir, said he to Ganem, as
soon as he came in, I am come from the commander
of the true believers, my master and yours; the orders
I have, differ very much from those which I do
not care to revive in your memory. I am to bear
you company, and to present you to the caliph, who
is desirous to see you. Ganem returned no other
answer to the vizier&rsquo;s compliments than by profoundly
bowing his head, and then mounted a horse
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
brought from the caliph&rsquo;s stables, which he managed
very gracefully. The mother and daughter were
mounted on mules belonging to the palace; and
whilst Fetnah led them a by-way to the prince&rsquo;s
court, Giafar conducted Ganem another way, and
brought him into the presence-chamber. The caliph
was there sitting on his throne, encompassed with
emirs, viziers, and other attendants and courtiers,
Arabs, Persians, Egyptians, Africans, and Syrians,
of his own dominions, not to mention strangers.</p>
<p>When the vizier had conducted Ganem to the foot
of the throne, that young merchant paid his obeisance,
prostrating himself with his face on the ground; and
then rising, made his compliment in verse, which,
though <i>extempore</i>, met with the approbation of the
whole court.</p>
<p>After his compliment, the caliph caused him to
draw near, and said to him, I am glad to see you,
and desire to hear from your own mouth where you
found my favourite, and all that you did for her.
Ganem obeyed, and appeared so sincere, that the
caliph was convinced of the reality of what he said.
That prince ordered a very rich vest to be given him,
according to the custom observed with those who are
admitted to audience. After which, he said to him,
Ganem, I will have you live in my court. Commander
of the true believers, answered the young
merchant, a slave has no will but his master&rsquo;s, on
whom his life and fortune depend. The caliph was
highly pleased with Ganem&rsquo;s answer, and assigned
him a considerable pension. Then that prince came
down from his throne, and causing only Ganem and
the grand vizier to follow him, went into his own
apartment. Not questioning but Fetnah was there,
with Abou Ayoub&rsquo;s widow and daughter, he caused
them to be called in. They fell down before him:
he made them rise, and was so taken with Alcolomb&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
beauty, that, after viewing her very attentively, he
said, I am so sorry for having treated your charms
so unworthily, that I owe them such a satisfaction
as may surpass the injury I have done them: I take
you to wife; and by that means shall punish Zobeide,
who shall become the first cause of your good
fortune, as she was of your past sufferings. This is
not all, added he, turning towards Ganem&rsquo;s mother;
you are still young; I believe you will not disdain to
be allied to my grand vizier: I give you to Giafar.
Let a cadi and witnesses be called, and the three contracts
be drawn up and signed immediately. Ganem
would have represented to the caliph, that it would be
honour enough for his sister to be one of his favourites;
but that prince was resolved to marry her.</p>
<p>He thought this such an extraordinary story, that
he ordered a famous historian to commit it to writing,
with all its circumstances. It was afterwards laid up
in his library; and many copies being transcribed
from that original, it became public.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><br />THE STORY OF
<br />PRINCE ZEYN ALASNAM, AND THE KING OF THE GENII.</h2>
<p>A king of Balsora, who possessed great wealth
and was well beloved by his subjects, had no children,
which was a great affliction to him; and therefore
he made presents to all the holy persons in his
dominions to engage them to beg a son for him of
Heaven: and their prayers being effectual, the queen
proved with child, and was happily delivered of a
prince who was named Zeyn Alasnam, which signifies
Ornament of the Statues.</p>
<p>The king caused all the astrologers in his kingdom
to be assembled, and ordered them to calculate the
infant&rsquo;s nativity. They found by their observations,
that he would live long and be very brave; but that
all his courage would be little enough to bear him
through the misfortunes that would threaten him.
The king was not daunted at the prediction. My
son, said he, is not to be pitied, since he will be
brave: it is fit that princes should have a taste of
misfortunes; for adversity tries virtue, and they are
the fitter to reign.</p>
<p>He rewarded the astrologers, and dismissed them;
and caused Zeyn to be educated with the greatest
care imaginable; appointing him able masters as
soon as he was of age to receive their instructions.
In short, he proposed to make him an accomplished
prince; when, on a sudden, that good king fell sick
of a distemper which all the skill of his physicians
could not cure. Perceiving his disease was mortal,
he sent for his son, and among other things advised
<span class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
him rather to endeavour to be beloved than to be
feared by his people; not to give ear to flatterers;
to be as slow in rewarding as in punishing; because
it often happens that monarchs, misled by false appearances,
load wicked men with favours, and oppress
the innocent.</p>
<p>As soon as king Zeyn was dead, prince Zeyn went
into mourning, which he wore seven days, and the
eighth he ascended the throne, taking his father&rsquo;s
seal off the royal treasure, and putting on his own.
He began thus to taste the sweets of ruling, the
pleasure of seeing all his courtiers bow down before
him, and make it their whole business to show their
zeal and obedience. In a word, the sovereign power
was too agreeable to him. He only regarded what
his subjects owed to him, without considering what
his duty was towards them, and consequently took
little care to govern them well. He wallowed in all
sorts of debauchery among the voluptuous youth, on
whom he conferred the prime employments in the
kingdom; so that there was nothing regular. Being
naturally prodigal, he set no bounds to his grants, so
that his women and his favourites insensibly drained
his treasure.</p>
<p>The queen his mother was still living, a discreet
wise princess. She had several times unsuccessfully
tried to give some check to her son&rsquo;s prodigality and
debauchery; giving him to understand, that if he did
not soon take another course, he would not only
squander his wealth, but would also alienate the
minds of his people, and occasion some revolution,
which perhaps might cost him his crown and his life.
What she had foretold was very near falling out;
the people began to mutter against the government,
and their muttering had certainly been followed by a
general revolt, had not the queen by her dexterity
prevented it. But that princess, being informed of
<span class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
the ill posture of affairs, gave notice to the king, who
at last suffered himself to be prevailed upon. He
committed the government to discreet ancient men,
who knew how to keep the people within the bounds
of duty.</p>
<p>Zeyn, seeing all his wealth consumed, repented
that he had made no better use of it. He fell into
a dismal melancholy, and nothing could comfort him.
One night he saw in a dream, a venerable old man,
who came towards him, and with a smiling countenance
said, Know, Zeyn, that there is no sorrow
but what is followed by mirth, no misfortune but
what in the end brings some happiness. If you desire
to see the end of your affliction, get up, set out for
Egypt, go to Grand Cairo: a greater fortune attends
you there.</p>
<p>The prince, when he awaked in the morning, reflected
on his dream, and talked of it very seriously
to his mother, who only laughed at it. My son, said
she to him, would you now go into Egypt upon belief
of that fine dream? Why not, madam? answered
Zeyn: do you imagine all dreams are chimerical?
No, no, some of them are mysterious. My masters
have told me a thousand stories, which will not permit
me to doubt of it. Besides, though I were not
otherwise convinced, I could not forbear giving some
credit to it. The old man that appeared to me had
something supernatural. He was not one of those
men whom nothing but age makes venerable; there
appeared a sort of divine air about his person. In
short, he was such a one as our great prophet is
represented; and if you will have me tell you what
I think, I believe it was he, who, pitying my affliction,
designs to ease it: I rely on the confidence he
has inspired me with. I am full of his promises,
and have resolved to follow his advice. The queen
endeavoured to dissuade him; but it was in vain.
<span class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
The prince committed to her the government of the
kingdom, set out one night very privately from his
palace, and took the road to Cairo, without suffering
any person to attend him.</p>
<p>After much trouble and fatigue, he arrived at that
famous city, like which there are few in the world
either for extent or beauty. He alighted at the gate
of a mosque, where, being spent with weariness, he
lay down. No sooner was he fallen asleep, than he
saw the same old man, who said to him, I am pleased
with you, my son; you have given credit to my words.
You are come hither, without being deterred by the
length or the difficulties of the way: but take notice,
that I have not put you upon undertaking such a long
journey upon any other design than to make trial of
you. I find you have courage and resolution. You
deserve I should make you the greatest and richest
prince in the world. Return to Balsora, and you
shall find immense wealth in your palace. No king
ever possessed so much as is there.</p>
<p>The prince was not pleased with that dream.&mdash;Alas!
thought he to himself, when he awaked, how
much was I mistaken! That old man, whom I took
for our prophet, is no other than the product of my
disturbed imagination. My fancy was so full of him,
that it is no wonder I have seen him again. I had
best return to Balsora; what should I do here any
longer? It is very happy that I told none but my
mother the occasion of my journey: I should become
a jest to my people if they knew it.</p>
<p>Accordingly he set out again for his kingdom;
and as soon as he arrived there, the queen asked
him, whether he returned well pleased. He told her
all that had happened; and he was so much concerned
for having been so credulous, that the queen, instead
of adding to his vexation by reproving or laughing
at him, comforted him. Forbear afflicting yourself,
<span class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
my son, said she; if God has appointed you riches,
you will have them without any trouble. Be easy:
all that I recommend to you is, to be virtuous. Renounce
the delight of dancing, music, and high-coloured
wine: shun all pleasures; they have already
almost ruined you: apply yourself to the making of
your subjects happy; and, securing their happiness,
you will fix your own.</p>
<p>Prince Zeyn swore he would for the future follow
his mother&rsquo;s advice, and be directed by the wise
viziers she had made choice of to assist him in supporting
the weight of the government. But the very
first night after he returned to his palace, he the
third time saw in a dream the old man, who said to
him, Brave Zeyn, the time of your prosperity is
come. To-morrow morning, as soon as you are up,
take a little pick-axe, and go dig in your father&rsquo;s
closet; you will there find a mighty treasure.</p>
<p>As soon as the prince awaked, he got up, ran to
the queen&rsquo;s apartment, and with much earnestness
told her the new dream of that night. Really, my
son, said his mother, that is a very positive man:
he is not satisfied with having deceived you twice;
have you a mind to believe him again? No, madam,
answered Zeyn, I give no credit to what he has
said; but I will, for my own satisfaction, search my
father&rsquo;s closet. I really fancied so, cried the queen,
laughing very heartily: go, my son, please yourself;
my comfort is, that work is not so toilsome as the
journey to Egypt.</p>
<p>Well, madam, answered the king, I must own that
this third dream has restored my belief, for it agrees
with the two others; and, in short, let us examine
the old man&rsquo;s words. He first directed me to go
into Egypt; there he told me, he had put me upon
taking that journey only to try me. Return to Balsora,
said he; that is the place where you are to find
<span class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
treasures: this night he has exactly pointed out the
place where they are. These three dreams, in my
opinion, are connected. After all, they may be chimerical;
but I would rather search in vain, than
blame myself as long as I live for having perhaps
missed of great riches, by being unseasonably too
hard of belief.</p>
<p>Having spoken these words, he left the queen&rsquo;s
apartment, caused a pick-axe to be brought him, and
went alone into the late king&rsquo;s closet. He fell to breaking
up the ground, and took up above half the square
stones it was paved with; and yet found not the
least appearance of what he sought after. He ceased
working to take a little rest, thinking within himself,
I am much afraid my mother had cause enough to
laugh at me. However, he took heart, and went on
with his labour: nor had he cause to repent; for, on
a sudden, he discovered a white stone, which he
took up, and under it found a door made fast with a
steel padlock, which he broke with the pick-axe,
and opened the door, which covered a staircase of
white marble. He immediately lighted a candle,
and went down those stairs into a room, the floor
whereof was laid with tiles of china-ware, and the
roofs and walls were of crystal; but he particularly
fixed his eyes on four places a little raised above the
rest of the floor, on each of which there were ten
urns of porphyry stone. He fancied they were full
of wine: Well, said he, that wine must needs be
very old; I do not question but it is excellent.
He went up to one of the urns, took off the cover,
and, with no less joy than surprise, perceived it
was full of pieces of gold. He searched all the
forty, one after another, and found them full of the
same coin, took out a handful, and carried it to the
queen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>That princess was as much amazed as can be imagined,
when the king gave her an account of what he
had seen. Oh! my son, said she, take heed that you
do not lavish away all that treasure foolishly, as you
have already done the royal treasure: let not your
enemies have so much occasion to rejoice. No, madam,
answered Zeyn, I will from henceforward live
after such a manner as shall be pleasing to you.</p>
<p>The queen desired the king her son to conduct her
to that wonderful subterraneous place, which the late
king her husband had made with such secrecy, that
she had never heard the least account of it. Zeyn
led her to the closet, down the marble stairs, and into
the chamber where the urns were. She observed
every thing with singular curiosity, and in a corner
spied a little urn of the same sort of stone as the
others. The prince had not before taken notice of it,
but opening, found in it a golden key. My son, said
the queen, the key certainly belongs to some other
treasure; let us look all about; perhaps we may discover
the use it is designed for.</p>
<p>They viewed all the chamber with the utmost exactness,
and at length found a key-hole in one of the
pannels of the wall, and guessed it to be that the key
belonged to. The king immediately tried, and as
readily opened the door, which led into a chamber,
in the midst of which were nine pedestals of massy
gold, on eight of which stood as many statues, each
of them made of one single diamond, and from them
came such a brightness that the whole room was perfectly
light.</p>
<p>O Heavens! cried Zeyn, in a wonderful surprise,
where could my father find such rarities? The ninth
pedestal redoubled their amazement, for it was covered
with a piece of white satin, on which were
written these words: &lsquo;Dear son, it cost me much toil
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
to get these statues: but though they are extraordinary
beautiful, you must understand that there is a
ninth in the world which surpasses them all: that
alone is worth more than a thousand such as these.
If you desire to be master of it, go to the city of
Cairo in Egypt: one of my old slaves, whose name is
Morabec, lives there; you will easily find him; the
first person you shall meet will show you his house:
go seek, and tell him all that has befallen you. He
will know you to be my son, and he will conduct you
to the place where that wonderful statue is, which
you will get with safety.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The prince, having read those words, said to the
queen, I will not be without that ninth statue; it must
certainly be a very rare piece, since all these here
are not of so great value together. I will set out
speedily for Grand Cairo; nor do I believe, madam,
that you will oppose my design. No, my son, answered
the queen, I am not against it: you are certainly
under the special protection of our great prophet;
he will not suffer you to perish in this journey.
Set out when you think fit; your viziers and I will
take care of the government during your absence.
The prince made ready his equipage, but would take
only a small number of slaves with him.</p>
<p>Nothing remarkable befell him by the way; but
arriving at Cairo, he inquired for Morabec. The
people told him he was one of the wealthiest inhabitants
of the city; that he lived like a great lord,
and that he kept open house, especially for strangers.
Zeyn was conducted thither, knocked at the gate,
which a slave opened, and said, What is your want?
and who are you? I am a stranger, answered the
prince; and, having heard much of lord Morabec&rsquo;s
generosity, am come to take up my lodging with him.
The slave desired Zeyn to stay a while, and went to
acquaint his master, who ordered him to desire the
<span class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
stranger to walk in. The slave returned to the gate,
and told the prince he was welcome.</p>
<p>Zeyn went in, crossed a large court, and entered
into a hall magnificently furnished, where Morabec
expected him, and received him very courteously, returning
thanks for the honour he did him in accepting
of a lodging in his house. The prince, having answered
his compliments, said to Morabec, I am son
to the late king of Balsora, and my name is Zeyn
Alasnam. The king, said Morabec, was formerly my
master; but, my lord, I never knew of any children
he had. What age are you of? I am twenty years
old, answered the prince. How long is it since you
left my father&rsquo;s court? Almost two and twenty years,
replied Morabec. But how can you convince me that
you are his son? My father, replied Zeyn, had a subterraneous
place under his closet, in which I have
found forty porphyry urns full of gold. And what
more is there? said Morabec. There are, answered
the prince, nine pedestals of massy gold, on eight
whereof are eight diamond statues, and on the ninth is
a piece of white satin, on which my father has written
what I am to do to get another statue, more valuable
than all those together. You know where the statue
is; for it mentioned on the satin that you will conduct
me to it.</p>
<p>As soon as he had spoken these words, Morabec
fell down at his feet, and kissing one of his hands several
times, said, I bless God for having brought you
hither: I know you to be the king of Balsora&rsquo;s son.
If you will go to the palace where the wonderful statue
is, I will conduct you; but you must first rest
here a few days. This day I treat the great men of
the court: we were at table when word was brought
me of your being at the door. Will you vouchsafe to
come and be merry with us? I shall be very glad, replied
Zeyn, to be admitted to your feast. Morabec
<span class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
immediately led him into a dome where the company
was, seated him at table, and served him on his knee.
The great men of Cairo were surprised, and whispered
to one another, Who is this stranger to whom
Morabec pays so much respect?</p>
<p>When they had dined, Morabec, directing his discourse
to the company, said, Great men of Cairo, do
not think much to see me serve this young stranger
after this manner: be it known to you, that he is the
son of the king of Balsora, my master. His father
purchased me with his money, and died without
making me free; so that I am still a slave, and consequently
all I have of right belongs to this young
prince, his sole heir. Here Zeyn interrupted him,
saying, Morabec, I declare before all these lords, that
I make you free from this moment, and that I renounce
all right to your person, and all you possess.
Consider what you would have me do more for you.
Morabec then kissed the ground, and returned the
prince most hearty thanks. Wine was then brought
in, which they drank all the day, and towards evening
presents were distributed among the guests, who then
went away.</p>
<p>The next day, Zeyn said to Morabec, I have taken
rest enough: I came not to Cairo to take my pleasure;
my design is to get the ninth statue: it is time
for us to set out in search of it. Sir, said Morabec,
I am ready to comply with your desires; but you
know not what dangers you must encounter to gain
the precious conquest. Whatsoever the danger may
be, answered the prince, I am resolved to undertake
it; I will either perish or succeed. All that happens
in this world is by God&rsquo;s direction: do you but bear
me company, and let your resolution be equal to
mine.</p>
<p>Morabec finding him resolved to set out, called his
<span class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
servants, and ordered them to make ready his equipage.
Then the prince and he performed the ablution,
or washing, and the prayer enjoined, which is
called Farz; and, that done, they set out. By the
way they took notice of abundance of strange and
wonderful things, and travelled many days; at the
end whereof, being come to a delicious place, they
alighted from their horses. Then Morabec said to
all the servants that attended them, Do you stay in
this place, and take care of our equipage till we return.
Next, he said to Zeyn, Now, sir, let us two
go on by ourselves: we are near the dreadful place
where the ninth statue is kept. You will stand in
need of all your courage.</p>
<p>They soon came to a lake; and Morabec sat down
on the brink of it, saying to the prince, We must
cross this sea. How can we cross it, answered Zeyn,
when we have no boat? You will see one appear in a
moment, replied Morabec: the enchanted boat of the
king of the genii will come for us. But do not forget
what I am going to say to you: you must observe a
profound silence; do not speak to the waterman,
though his figure seem ever so strange to you: whatsoever
you observe, say nothing: for I tell you beforehand,
that if you utter the least word when you are
embarked, the boat will sink down. I shall take care
to hold my peace, said the prince: you need only
tell me what I am to do, and I will strictly observe it.</p>
<p>Whilst they were talking, he spied on a sudden a
boat in the lake, and it was made of red sanders. It
had a mast of fine amber, and a blue satin flag. There
was only one waterman in it, whose head was like an
elephant&rsquo;s, and his body like a tiger&rsquo;s. When the
boat was come up to the prince and Morabec, the
monstrous waterman took them up one after another
with his trunk, and put them into the boat, and then
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
carried them over the lake in a moment. He then
again took them up with his trunk, set them ashore,
and immediately vanished with his boat.</p>
<p>Now we may talk, said Morabec: the island we
are on belongs to the king of the genii; there are no
more such throughout the world. Look all about you,
prince; can there be a more delightful place? It is
certainly a lively representation of the charming
place God has appointed for the faithful observers of
our law. Behold the fields, adorned with all sorts
of flowers and odoriferous plants: admire those fine
trees, whose delicious fruit makes the branches hang
down to the ground: enjoy the delight of those harmonious
songs formed in the air by a thousand birds,
of as many various sorts, unknown in other countries.
Zeyn could never sufficiently admire the beauty of
those things that were about him, and still found
something new as he advanced farther into the
island.</p>
<p>At length they came before a palace all of fine
emeralds, encompassed with a ditch, on the banks
whereof, at certain distances, were planted such tall
trees that they shaded the whole palace. Before the
gate, which was of massy gold, was a bridge made of
one single shell of a fish, though it was at least six
fathoms long and three in breadth. At the head of
the bridge stood a company of genii, of a prodigious
height, who guarded the entrance into the castle with
great clubs of china steel.</p>
<p>Let us go no farther, said Morabec; these genii
will beat our brains out; and if we would prevent
their coming to us, we must perform a magical ceremony.
He then drew out of a purse he had under
his garment four long stripes of yellow taffety; one he
put about his middle, and laid the other on his back,
giving the other two to the prince, who did the like.
Then Morabec laid on the ground two large table-cloths,
<span class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
on the edges whereof he scattered some precious
stones, musk, and amber. Then he sat down
on one of those cloths, and Zeyn on the other; and
Morabec said to the prince, I will now, sir, conjure
the king of the genii, who lives in the palace that is
before us, that he may come peaceably to us. I confess
I am somewhat uneasy about the reception he is
like to give us. If our coming into this island is displeasing
to him, he will appear in the shape of a dreadful
monster; but if he approves of our design, he will
come in the shape of a handsome man. As soon as
he appears before us, you must rise and salute him,
without going off your cloth; for you would certainly
perish, should you stir off it. You may say to him,
Sovereign lord of the genii, my father, who was your
servant, has been taken away by the angel of death;
I wish your majesty may protect me, as you always
protected my father. If the king of the genii ask you
what favour you desire of him, you must answer,
Sir, I most humbly beg of you to give me the ninth
statue.</p>
<p>Morabec having thus instructed prince Zeyn, began
his conjuration. Immediately their eyes were
dazzled with a long flash of lightning, which was followed
by a clap of thunder. The whole island was
covered with a hideous darkness, a furious storm of
wind blew, a dreadful cry was heard, the island felt
a shock, and there was such an earthquake as that
which Asrasyel is to cause on the day of judgment.</p>
<p>Zeyn was somewhat startled, and began to look
upon that noise as a very ill omen, when Morabec,
who knew better than he what to think of it, began
to smile, and said, Be not dismayed, my prince, all
goes well. In short, that very moment the king of
the genii appeared in the shape of a very handsome
man; yet there was something of sternness in his air.</p>
<p>As soon as prince Zeyn had made him the compliment
<span class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
he had been taught by Morabec, the king of the
genii, smiling, answered, My son, I loved your father;
and every time he came to pay me his respects, I presented
him with a statue, which he carried away
with him. I have no less kindness for you. I obliged
your father, some days before he died, to write that
which you read on the piece of white satin. I promised
him to receive you under my protection, and to give
you the ninth statue, which in beauty surpasses those
you have already. I have begun to perform my promise
to him. It was I whom you saw in a dream in
the shape of an old man: I caused you to open the
subterraneous place where the urns and the statues
are: I have a great share in all that has befallen
you, or rather am the occasion of it. I know the
motive that brought you hither; and you shall obtain
what you desire. Though I had not promised your
father to give it, I would willingly grant it you; but
you must first swear to me by all that is sacred, that
you will return to this island, and that you will bring
a maid that is in her fifteenth year, and who has never
known man, nor desired to know any. She must also
be perfectly beautiful, and you so much master of
yourself, as not even to desire to enjoy her, as you
are conducting her hither.</p>
<p>Zeyn took the rash oath that was required of him.
But, sir, said he, then suppose I should be so fortunate
as to meet with such a maid as you require, how
shall I know that I have found her? I own, answered
the king of the genii smiling, that you might be mistaken
in her mien: that knowledge is above the sons
of Adam, and therefore I do not intend to depend
upon your judgment in that particular; I will give
you a looking-glass, which will be surer than your
conjectures. When you shall have seen a maid fifteen
years of age, perfectly beautiful, you shall only
need to look into the glass, in which you shall see the
<span class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
maiden&rsquo;s representation. If she be chaste, the glass
will remain clear and unsullied; but if, on the contrary,
it sullies, that will be a certain sign that she
has not been always undefiled, or at least that she
has desired to cease being so. Do not forget the
oath you have taken; be sure to keep it, as becomes
a man of honour, otherwise I will take away your
life, as much kindness as I have for you. Prince
Zeyn Alasnam protested over again that he would
faithfully keep his word.</p>
<p>Then the king of the genii delivered to him a looking-glass,
saying, My son, you may return when you
please: there is the glass you are to make use of.
Zeyn and Morabec took leave of the king of the genii,
and went towards the lake. The waterman with the
elephant&rsquo;s head brought his boat, and carried them
over the lake as he had done before. They joined
their servants, and returned with them again to Cairo.</p>
<p>Prince Alasnam rested a few days at Morabec&rsquo;s
house, and then said to him, Let us go to Bagdad, to
seek a maiden for the king of the genii. Why, are we
not at Grand Cairo? said Morabec: shall we not there
find beautiful maidens enough? You are in the right,
answered the prince; but how shall we do to find
where they are? Do not trouble yourself about that,
sir, answered Morabec; I know a very cunning old
woman, whom I will intrust with that affair, and she
will acquit herself well of it.</p>
<p>Accordingly the old woman found means to show
the prince a considerable number of beautiful maidens
of fifteen years of age; but when he had viewed them,
and came to consult his looking-glass, the fatal touchstone
of their virtue, the glass always appeared sullied.
All the maidens in the court and city, that were
in their fifteenth year, underwent the trial one after
another, and the glass never remained bright and
clear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>When they saw there were no chaste maids to be
found in Cairo, they went away to Bagdad, where
they hired a magnificent palace in one of the chief
corners of the city, and began to live splendidly.
They kept open house; and, after all people had
eaten in the palace, the fragments were carried to
the dervises, who, by that means, had convenient
subsistence.</p>
<p>There lived in that quarter an iman, whose name
was Boubekir Mouesm, a vain, haughty, and envious
person: he hated the rich, only because he was poor,
his misery incensing him against his neighbour&rsquo;s prosperity.
He heard talk of Zeyn Alasnam, and of the
plenty his house afforded. This was enough for him
to take an aversion to that prince; and it proceeded
so far, that one day, after the evening prayer, in the
mosque, he said to the people, Brethren, I have been
told a stranger is come to live in our ward, who is at
a prodigious expense every day. How can we tell
but that this unknown person is some villain, who
has committed a great robbery in his own country,
and comes hither to make much of himself? Let us
take heed, brethren; if the caliph should happen to
be informed that such a man is in our ward, it is to be
feared that he will punish us for not acquainting him
with it: I declare, for my part, I wash my hands of
it; and if any thing should happen amiss, it shall not
lie at my door. The multitude, who were easily led
away, unanimously cried to Boubekir, It is your business,
doctor; do you acquaint the council with it. The
iman went home well pleased, and drew up a memorial,
resolving to present it to the caliph the next day.</p>
<p>But Morabec, who had been at prayers, and heard
all that was said by the doctor as well as the rest of
the company, put five hundred pieces of gold into a
handkerchief, made up with a parcel of several silks,
and went away to Boubekir&rsquo;s house. The doctor
<span class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
asked him in a harsh tone what he wanted. Doctor,
answered Morabec, with an obliging air, and at the
same time putting into his hand the gold and the
silk, I am your neighbour and your servant; I come
from prince Zeyn, who lives in this ward. He has
heard of your worth, and has ordered me to come and
tell you, that he desires to be acquainted with you;
and, in the mean time, desires you to accept of this
small present. Boubekir was transported with joy,
and answered Morabec thus: Be pleased, sir, to beg
the prince&rsquo;s pardon for me: I am ashamed I have not
yet been to see him, but I will atone for my fault, and
wait on him to-morrow.</p>
<p>Accordingly the next day, after morning prayer, he
said to the people, You must understand, brethren,
that no man is without some enemies. Envy pursues
those chiefly who are very rich. The stranger I spoke
to you about yesterday in the evening is no ill man,
as some ill-designing persons would have persuaded
me: he is a young prince, endued with all manner of
virtues. It behoves us to take care how we go about
to give any ill account of him to the caliph.</p>
<p>Boubekir, having thus wiped off the ill impression
he had the day before given the people concerning
Zeyn, returned home, put on his best apparel, and
went to visit that young prince, who gave him a courteous
reception. After several compliments had passed
on both sides, Boubekir said to the prince, Sir, do
you design to stay long at Bagdad? I shall stay, answered
Zeyn, till I can find a maid fifteen years of
age, perfectly beautiful, and so chaste, that she has
not only never known a man, but even never desired
to know one. You seek after a rarity, replied the
iman; and I should be apt to fear your search would
prove unsuccessful, did I not know where there is a
maid of that character. Her father was formerly vizier;
but he has left the court, and lived a long time
<span class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
in a house out of the way, where he applies himself
only to the education of his daughter. If you please,
I will go ask her of him for you: I do not question
but he will be overjoyed to have a son-in-law of your
quality. Not so fast, said the prince; I shall not
marry that maid before I know whether I like her.
As for her beauty, I can depend on you: but what
assurance can you give me in relation to her virtue?
What assurance do you require? said Boubekir. I
must see her face, answered Zeyn; that is enough for
me to come to a resolution. You are skilful, then, in
physiognomy? replied the iman, smiling. Well, come
along with me to her father&rsquo;s: I will desire him to
let you see her one moment in his presence.</p>
<p>Mouesm conducted the prince to the vizier&rsquo;s, who,
as soon as he was acquainted with the prince&rsquo;s birth
and design, called his daughter, and made her take
off her veil. Never had the young king of Balsora
beheld such a perfect and powerful beauty. He stood
amazed; and, since he could then try whether the
maid was as chaste as fair, he pulled out his glass,
which remained bright and unsullied.</p>
<p>When he perceived he had at length found such a
person as he desired, he entreated the vizier to grant
her to him. Immediately the lady was sent for, and
came; the contract was signed, and the marriage-prayer
said. After which ceremony, Zeyn carried
the vizier to his house, where he treated him magnificently,
and gave him considerable presents.
Next, he sent a prodigious quantity of jewels to the
bride by Morabec, who brought her to his house,
where the wedding was kept with all the pomp that
became Zeyn&rsquo;s quality. When all the company was
dismissed, Morabec said to his master, Let us be
gone, sir; let us not stay any longer at Bagdad, but
return to Cairo: remember the promise you made
the king of the genii. Let us go, answered the prince;
<span class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
I must take care to perform it exactly: yet I must
confess, my dear Morabec, that, if I obey the king of
the genii, it is not without reluctancy. The person I
have married is charming, and I am tempted to carry
her to Balsora, and place her on the throne. Alas!
sir, answered Morabec, take heed how you give way
to your inclination. Make yourself master of your
passions; and, whatsoever it costs you, be as good as
your word to the king of the genii. Well then, Morabec,
said the prince, do you take care to conceal
that lovely maid from me: let her never appear in
my sight. Perhaps I have already seen too much of
her.</p>
<p>Morabec having made all ready for their departure,
they returned to Cairo, and thence set out for the
island of the king of the genii. When they were there,
the maid, who had performed the journey in a horse-litter,
and whom the prince had never seen since his
wedding-day, said to Morabec, Where are we? shall
we be soon in the dominions of the prince my husband?
Madam, answered Morabec, it is time to undeceive
you. Prince Zeyn married you, only in order
to get you from your father; he did not engage
his faith to you to make you sovereign of Balsora,
but to deliver you to the king of the genii, who has
asked of him a virgin of your character. Hearing
these words, she wept bitterly, which moved the
prince and Morabec. Take pity on me, said she; I
am a stranger: you will be accountable to God for
your treachery towards me.</p>
<p>Her tears and complaints were of no effect, for she
was presented to the king of the genii, who, having
gazed on her very earnestly, said to Zeyn, Prince, I
am satisfied with your behaviour; the virgin you have
brought me is beautiful and chaste, and I am pleased
with the force you have put upon yourself to be as
good as your word to me. Return to your dominions,
<span class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
and when you shall enter the subterraneous room
where the eight statues are, you shall find the ninth
which I promised you. I will go and make my genii
carry it thither. Zeyn thanked the king, and returned
to Cairo with Morabec, but did not stay long there;
his impatience to see the ninth statue made him hasten
his journey. However, he could not but often
think of the young virgin he married; and, blaming
himself for having deceived her, he looked upon himself
as the cause and instrument of her misfortune.
Alas! said he to himself, I have taken her from a
tender father to sacrifice her to a genie. O incomparable
beauty! you deserve a better fate.</p>
<p>Prince Zeyn, disturbed with these thoughts, at
length reached Balsora, where his subjects made
extraordinary rejoicings for his return. He went
directly to give his mother an account of his journey,
who was in a rapture to hear he had obtained the
ninth statue. Let us go, my son, said she, let us go
and see it; for it is certainly in the chamber under
ground, since the king of the genii told you you should
find it there. The young king and his mother, being
both impatient to see that wonderful statue, went down
into the subterraneous place, and into the room of
the statues: but how great was their surprise, when,
instead of a statue of diamonds, they spied on the
ninth pedestal a most beautiful virgin, whom the prince
knew to be the same he had conducted into the island
of the genii! Prince, said the young maid, you are
amazed to see me here: you expected to have found
something more precious than I; and I question not
but that you now repent having taken so much trouble:
you expected a better reward. Madam, answered
Zeyn, Heaven is my witness, that I more than
once thought to have broke my word with the king of
the genii, to keep you to myself. Whatsoever the
value of a diamond statue may be, is it worth the satisfaction
<span class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
of enjoying you? I love you above all the
diamonds and wealth in the world.</p>
<p>Just as he had done speaking these words, a clap
of thunder was heard, which made that subterraneous
place shake. Zeyn&rsquo;s mother was frightened; but the
king of the genii, immediately appearing, dispelled
her dread. Madam, said he to her, I protect and love
your son: I had a mind to try whether, at his age, he
could subdue his passions. I know the charms of this
young lady have wrought on him, and that he did not
punctually keep the promise he had made me, not to
desire to enjoy her; but I am too well acquainted with
the frailty of the human race. This is the ninth statue
I designed for him; it is more rare and precious
than the others. Live, said he, (directing his discourse
to the young prince,) live happy, Zeyn, with
this young lady, who is your wife; and, if you would
have her true and constant to you, love her always,
and love her alone. Give her no rival, and I will answer
for her fidelity. Having spoken these words, the
king of the genii vanished; and Zeyn, ravished with
that young lady, consummated the marriage the same
day, and caused her to be proclaimed queen of Balsora.
Those two ever faithful and loving consorts lived together
many years.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><br />THE STORY OF
<br />CODADAD AND HIS BROTHERS.</h2>
<p>Those who have written the history of the kingdom
of Diarbekir inform us, that there formerly
reigned a most magnificent king in the city of Harran,
who loved his subjects, and was equally beloved
by them. He was endued with all virtues, and wanted
nothing to complete his happiness but an heir.
Though he had the finest women in the world in his
seraglio, yet he was destitute of children. He continually
prayed to Heaven for them; and one night,
in his sleep, a comely person, or rather a prophet,
appeared to him, and said, Your prayers are heard;
you have obtained what you desired: rise as soon as
you awake, go to your prayers, and make two genuflections:
then walk into the garden of your palace,
call your gardener, and bid him bring you a pomegranate;
eat as many of the seeds as you think fit,
and your wishes shall be accomplished.</p>
<p>The king, calling to mind his dream when he awaked,
returned thanks to Heaven, got up, and fell to his
prayers, made two genuflections, and then went down
into his garden, where he took fifty pomegranate-seeds,
which he counted, and ate them. He had
fifty wives who shared in his bed; they all proved
with child; but there was one called Pirouze, who
did not appear to be big-bellied. He took an aversion
to that lady, and would have her put to death.
Her barrenness, said he, is a certain token that Heaven
does not judge Pirouze worthy to bear a prince;
it is my duty to deliver the world from an object that
is odious to the Lord. He had taken this cruel resolution,
<span class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
but his vizier diverted him from putting it in
execution; representing to him, that all women were
not of the same constitution, and that it was not impossible
but that Pirouze might be with child, though
it did not appear. Well, answered the king, let her
live; but let her depart my court, for I cannot endure
her. Your majesty, replied the vizier, may send
her to prince Samer, your cousin. The king approved
of his advice: he sent Pirouze to Samaria with a letter,
in which he ordered his cousin to treat her well;
and, in case she proved with child, to give him notice
of her being brought to bed.</p>
<p>No sooner was Pirouze arrived in that country,
than it appeared that she was with child; and at length
she was delivered of a most beautiful prince. The
prince of Samaria wrote immediately to the king of
Harran, to acquaint him with the birth of that son,
and to congratulate him on that occasion. The king
was much rejoiced at it, and answered prince Samer
as follows: &lsquo;Cousin, all my other wives have also
been delivered of each a prince; so that we have a
great number of children here. I desire you to breed
up that of Pirouze, to give him the name of Codadad,
and to send him to me when I shall give you notice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The prince of Samaria spared nothing that might
improve the education of his nephew. He taught him
to ride, shoot with a bow, and all the other things
becoming the son of a king; so that Codadad, at
eighteen years of age, was looked upon as a prodigy.
This young prince, being inspired with a courage
worthy his birth, said one day to his mother, Madam,
I begin to grow weary of Samaria: I find myself inclined
to gain renown; give me leave to go seek it
amidst the perils of war. My father, the king of
Harran, has many enemies. Some neighbouring
princes make it their business to disturb him. Why
does he not call me to his assistance? Why does he
<span class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
leave me here so long, like an infant? Must I spend
my life here in sloth, when all my brothers have the
good fortune to be fighting by his side? My son, answered
Pirouze, I am no less impatient to have your
name become famous; I could wish you had already
signalized yourself against your father&rsquo;s enemies;
but we must wait till he requires it. No, madam,
replied Codadad, I have already waited but too long.
I long to see the king, and am tempted to go to offer
him my service as a young gentleman unknown. No
doubt but he will accept of it, and I will not discover
myself till I have performed a thousand glorious
actions: I design to merit his esteem before he
knows who I am. Pirouze approved of his generous
resolution; and Codadad one day departed from Samaria,
as if he had been going a-hunting, without acquainting
prince Samer, for fear he should thwart his
design.</p>
<p>He was mounted on a white horse, who had a gold
bit and shoes; his housing was of blue satin, embroidered
with pearls; the hilt of his scimitar was of
one entire diamond; and the scabbard of sandal-wood,
all adorned with emeralds and rubies; and on his
shoulder hung his bow and quiver. In this equipage,
which added much to his good mien, he arrived at the
city of Harran, and soon found means to offer his service
to the king; who, being charmed with his beauty
and lovely presence, and perhaps inspired by natural
sympathy, gave him a favourable reception, and asked
his name and quality. Sir, answered Codadad, I am
son to an emir of Grand Cairo: an inclination to travel
has made me quit my country; and, understanding,
in my passage through your dominions, that you
were engaged in war with some of your neighbours,
I am come to your court to offer your majesty my service.
The king showed him extraordinary kindness,
and employed him in his troops.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>That young prince soon signalized his bravery. He
gained the esteem of the officers, and was admired by
the soldiers; and, having no less wit than courage,
he so far advanced himself in the king&rsquo;s affection as
to become his favourite. All the ministers and other
courtiers daily resorted to Codadad, and were so
eager to purchase his friendship that they neglected
the king&rsquo;s other sons. Those princes could not but
resent it; and, imputing it to the stranger, they all
conceived an implacable hatred against him; but the
king&rsquo;s affection daily increasing, he was never weary
of giving him fresh testimonies of it. He always desired
he should be near him: he admired his discourse,
ever full of wit and discretion; and, to show
how much he was satisfied with his wisdom, he gave
him the tuition of the other princes, though he was of
the same age as they. Thus Codadad was made governor
of his brothers; which only served to heighten
their hatred. Is it come to this, said they, that the
king, not satisfied with loving a stranger more than
us, will have him to be our tutor, and not allow us to
do any thing without his leave? This is not to be endured:
we must rid ourselves of this stranger. Let
us go together, said one of them, and dispatch him.
No, no, answered another; we had better be cautious
how we sacrifice ourselves: his death would render
us odious to the king, who, in return would declare us
all unfit to reign. Let us destroy the stranger artfully.
We will ask leave to go a-hunting; and, when far
from the palace, we will proceed to some other city,
and stay there some time. The king will wonder at
our absence; and, perceiving we do not return, he
may perhaps put the stranger to death, or at least
will turn him out of the court, for suffering us to leave
the palace.</p>
<p>All the princes applauded this artifice, went together
to Codadad, and desired him to give them leave
<span class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
to go and take the diversion of hunting, promising to
return the same day. Pirouze&rsquo;s son was taken in the
snare, and granted the leave his brothers desired.
They went, but returned not. They had been three
days absent, when the king asked Codadad where the
princes were, for it was long since he had seen them.
Sir, answered Codadad, they have been gone a-hunting
these three days; but they promised me they
would return sooner. The king grew uneasy, and
much more when he perceived the princes did not
return the next day. This provoked his passion:
Indiscreet stranger, said he to Codadad, why did you
let my sons go without bearing them company? Is it
thus you discharge the trust I have reposed in you?
Go seek them immediately, or you are a dead man.</p>
<p>These words pierced Pirouze&rsquo;s unfortunate son to
the heart. He armed himself, went out of the city,
and, like a shepherd who had lost his flock, searched
all the country for his brothers, inquiring at every
village whether they had been seen; and, hearing no
news of them, was grieved to the heart. Alas! my
brothers, said he, what is become of you? Are you
perhaps fallen into the hands of our enemies? Am I
come to the court of Harran to be the occasion of
giving the king so much trouble? He was altogether
comfortless for having given the princes leave to go
a-hunting, or for not having borne them company.</p>
<p>After some days spent in a fruitless search, he
arrived in a plain of prodigious extent, in the midst
whereof was a palace all of black marble. He drew
near, and at one of the windows spied a most beautiful
lady, but set off with no other ornament than her own
beauty; for her hair was dishevelled, her garments
ragged, and on her countenance appeared all the
tokens of the greatest affliction. As soon as she saw
Codadad, and judged he might hear her, she directed
her discourse to him, saying, Alas! young man, get
<span class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
away from this fatal place, or else you will soon fall
into the hands of the monster that inhabits it. A
black who feeds only on human blood, resides in this
palace. He seizes all persons whom their ill fate
conducts to this plain, and shuts them up in his
dark dungeons, whence they are never released but
to be devoured by him.</p>
<p>Madam, answered Codadad, tell me who you are,
and be not concerned for any more. I am a maid of
quality, of Grand Cairo, replied the lady: I was passing
by this castle yesterday, in my way to Bagdad,
and met with the black, who killed all my servants,
and brought me hither. I wish I had nothing but
death to fear; but, to add to my calamity, this monster
would persuade me to love him; and, in case I
do not yield to-morrow to his brutality, I must expect
the utmost violence. I tell you once more, added she,
make your escape: the black will soon return: he is
gone out to pursue some travellers he spied at a distance
on the plain. Lose no time; nay, I know not
whether a speedy flight will deliver you from him.</p>
<p>She had scarce done speaking these words before
the black appeared. He was a man of a monstrous
bulk, and of a dreadful aspect, mounted on a mighty
Tartar horse, and wore such a large and heavy scimitar,
that none but he could make use of it. The
prince, seeing him, was amazed at his monstrous mien,
directed his prayers to Heaven to assist him, then
drew his scimitar, and stood still to expect the black;
who, despising so inconsiderable an enemy, called to
him to yield himself with engaging words; but Codadad,
by his behaviour, gave him to understand that
he was resolved to defend his life; for he drew near,
and gave him a great cut on the knee. The black,
feeling himself wounded, gave such a dreadful shriek
as made all the plain resound. He grew enraged,
foamed at the mouth, and raising himself on his
<span class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
stirrups, made at Codadad with his dreadful scimitar.
The stroke was so violent, that no more would have
been required to put an end to the prince, had not he,
by a sudden spring he made his horse take, avoided
it. The scimitar made a mighty hissing in the air;
but, before the black could have leisure to second
the blow, Codadad let fall one on his right arm with
such fury, that he cut it off. The dreadful scimitar
fell, with the hand that held it; and the black, yielding
under the violence of the stroke, lost his stirrups,
and made the earth quake with his mighty fall. The
prince alighted at the same time, and chopped off his
enemy&rsquo;s head. Just then the lady, who had been a
spectator of the combat, and was still offering up her
vows to Heaven for that young hero whom she admired,
gave a shriek for joy, and said to Codadad,
Prince, (for the mighty victory you have obtained convinces
me that you are of no ordinary extraction,) finish
the work you have begun: the black has the keys of
this castle: take them, and deliver me out of prison.
The prince searched the wretch&rsquo;s pockets, as he lay
stretched out on the ground, and found several keys.</p>
<p>He opened the first door, and went into a court,
where he met the lady coming to meet him. She would
have cast herself at his feet, in token of her gratitude;
but he would not permit her. She commended his
valour, and extolled him above all the heroes in the
world. He returned her compliments; and she appearing
still more lovely to him near at hand than at
a distance, I know not whether she was more joyful
to be delivered from the desperate danger she had
been in, than he for having done so considerable a
service to so beautiful a person.</p>
<p>Their discourse was interrupted by dismal cries
and groans. What is this I hear? said Codadad:
whence come those miserable cries which pierce our
ears? Sir, said the lady to him, pointing to a little
<span class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
door there was in the court, they come from thence.
There are I know not how many wretched persons,
whom fate has made to fall into the hands of the
black. They are all chained; and that monster drew
out one every day to be devoured.</p>
<p>It is an addition to my joy, answered the young
prince, to understand that my victory will save the
lives of those unfortunate persons. Come along with
me, madam, to partake in the satisfaction of giving
them their liberty. You may guess by yourself how
welcome we shall be to them. Having so said, they
advanced towards the door of the dungeon; and the
nearer they drew, the more distinctly they heard the
complaints of the prisoners. Codadad pitying them,
and impatient to put an end to their sufferings, put
one of the keys into the key-hole, which proved not
to be the right one at first, and therefore he took
another; at which noise all those unfortunate creatures,
concluding it was the black, who came, according
to custom, to bring them some meat, and at the
same time to seize one of them to eat himself, redoubled
their cries and groans. Lamentable voices
were heard, which sounded as if they had come from
the centre of the earth.</p>
<p>In the mean time, the prince had opened the door,
and went down a very steep stair-case into a large
and deep vault, which received some small light from
a little window, and in which there were above a hundred
persons bound to stakes, and their hands tied.
Unfortunate travellers, said he to them, wretched victims,
who only expected the moment of an approaching
cruel death, give thanks to Heaven, which has
this day delivered you by my means. I have slain
the black by whom you were to be devoured, and am
come to knock off your irons. The prisoners hearing
these words, all together gave a shout, occasioned by
joy and surprise. Codadad and the lady began to
<span class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
unbind them; and, as soon as any of them were loose,
they helped to take off the fetters from the rest; so
that in a short time they were all at liberty.</p>
<p>They then kneeled down, and, having returned
thanks to Codadad for what he had done for them,
went out of the dungeon; and when they were come
into the court, how surprising it was for the prince to
see among the prisoners those he was in search of,
and almost out of hopes to find! Princes, cried he,
am I not deceived? is it not you I behold? May I
flatter myself that it will be in my power to restore
you to the king your father, who is inconsolable for
the loss of you? But will he not have some one to
lament? Are you all here alive? Alas! the death of
one of you will suffice to damp all the joy I conceive
for having delivered you.</p>
<p>The forty-nine princes all made themselves known
to Codadad, who embraced them one after another,
and told them how uneasy their father was on account
of their absence. They gave their deliverer all the
commendations he deserved, as did the other prisoners,
who could not find words expressive enough
to declare the gratitude they were sensible of. Next,
Codadad, with them, took a view of the whole castle,
where there was immense wealth; curious silks, gold
brocades, Persian carpets, China satins, and an infinite
quantity of other goods, which the black had
taken from the caravans he had plundered, a considerable
part whereof belonged to the prisoners Codadad
had then set free. Every man knew and reclaimed
what belonged to him. The prince restored them
their own, and divided the rest of the merchandise
among them. Then he said to them, How will you do
to carry away your goods? we are here in a desert
place, and there is no likelihood of getting your horses.
Sir, answered one of the prisoners, the black robbed
us of our camels as well as our goods, and perhaps
<span class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
they may be in the stables of this castle. That is not
unlikely, replied Codadad; let us see after it. Accordingly
they went to the stables, where they not
only found the camels, but also the horses belonging
to the king of Harran&rsquo;s sons. There were some black
slaves in the stables; who, seeing all the prisoners
released, and guessing thereby that their master had
been killed, fled through by-ways well known to
them. Nobody minded to pursue them. All the merchants,
overjoyed that they had recovered their goods
and camels, together with their liberty, thought of
nothing but prosecuting their journey; but first repeated
their thanks to their deliverer.</p>
<p>When they were gone, Codadad, directing his discourse
to the lady, said, To what place, madam, do
you desire to go? whither did you design when you
were seized by the black? I intend to bear you company
to the place you shall appoint, and I do not
question but that all these princes will do the same.
The king of Harran&rsquo;s sons protested to the lady
they would not leave her till she was restored to her
friends.</p>
<p>Princes, said she, I am of a country too remote
from hence: and, besides that it would be an imposition
on your generosity to oblige you to travel so
far, I must own to you that I am come from my
native country for ever. I told you a while ago that
I was a lady of Grand Cairo; but since you have
shown me so much favour, and I am so highly
obliged to you, added she, looking upon Codadad,
I should be much in the wrong in concealing the
truth from you. I am a king&rsquo;s daughter; an usurper
has possessed himself of my father&rsquo;s throne after
having murdered him, and I have been forced to fly
to save my life.</p>
<p>Then Codadad and his brothers desired the princess
to tell them her story, assuring her they were
<span class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
highly concerned at her misfortunes, and fully disposed
to spare for nothing that might contribute towards
rendering her more happy. After thanks returned
for their fresh protestations of readiness to
serve her, she could not refuse satisfying their curiosity,
and began the recital of her adventures in the
following manner.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><br />STORY OF THE PRINCESS OF DERYABAR.</h2>
<p>There is, in a certain island, a great city called
Deryabar. It has been long governed by a potent,
magnificent, and virtuous king. That prince had no
children, which was the only thing wanting to make
him happy. He continually addressed his prayers
to Heaven; but Heaven granted his requests by
halves; for the queen his wife, after a long expectation,
brought forth a daughter.</p>
<p>I am the unfortunate princess. My father was
rather troubled than pleased at my birth; but he
submitted to the will of God, and caused me to be
educated with all possible care, being resolved, since
he had no son, to teach me the art of ruling, that I
might supply his place after his death.</p>
<p>One day, when he was taking the diversion of
hunting, he spied a wild ass, which he chased, lost
his company, and was carried away so far in that
heat, as to ride on till night, without reflecting that
he was quite out of the way. He then alighted, and
sat down at the edge of a wood, into which he had
observed the ass had taken. No sooner was the day
shut in, than he discovered a light among the trees,
which made him conclude that he was not far from
some village: he rejoiced at it, hoping that he might
pass the night there, and find some person to send to
his followers to acquaint them where he was; and
<span class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
accordingly he got up and walked towards the light,
which served to guide him.</p>
<p>He soon found he had been deceived, that light
being no other than a fire lighted in a hut: however,
he drew near, and with amazement beheld a great
black, or rather a dreadful giant, sitting on a sofa.
Before the monster was a great pitcher of wine, and
he was roasting a bullock he had newly killed.
Sometimes he drank out of the pitcher, and then cut
slices off the bullock and ate them. But that which
most drew the king my father&rsquo;s attention was a beautiful
woman he saw in the hut. She seemed to be
overwhelmed with grief; her hands were bound, and
at her feet was a small child, about two or three
years old, who, as if he was sensible of his mother&rsquo;s
misfortunes, continually wept, and rent the air with
cries.</p>
<p>My father being moved with that object of pity,
thought at first to have gone into the hut and attack
the giant; but considering it would be an unequal
combat, he stopped, and resolved, since he had not
strength enough to prevail by open force, to use
art.</p>
<p>In the mean time the giant, having emptied the
pitcher and devoured above half the bullock, turned
to the woman, and said, Beautiful princess, why do
you oblige me by your obstinacy to treat you with
severity? It is in your own power to be happy. You
need only to resolve to love and be true to me, and
I shall express my affection to you. Thou hideous
satyr, answered the lady, never expect that time
should wear away the aversion I have for you.
Thou wilt ever be a monster in my eyes. To these
words she added so many reproaches, that the giant
grew enraged. This is too much, cried he, in a furious
tone; my love undervalued is turned into rage.
Your hatred has at last caused mine; I find it prevails
<span class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
above my desires, and that I now wish your
death rather than enjoyment. Having spoken these
words, he took that wretched lady by the hair, held
her up with one hand in the air, and drawing his
scimitar with the other, was just going to strike off
her head, when the king my father let fly an arrow,
which pierced the giant&rsquo;s breast, so that he staggered
and dropped down dead.</p>
<p>My father entered the hut, unbound the lady&rsquo;s
hands, asked her who she was, and how she came
thither. Sir, said she, there are some families of
Saracens along the sea-coast, who live under a
prince who is my husband; this giant you have killed
was one of his principal officers. The wretch fell
desperately in love with me, but took special care to
conceal it, till he could put in execution the designs
he had laid of stealing me away. Fortune oftener
favours wicked designs than the virtuous. The giant
one day surprised me and my child in a by-place.
He seized us both; and, to disappoint the search he
well knew my husband would cause to be made on
account of this rape, he removed far from the country
inhabited by those Saracens, and brought us into
this wood, where he has kept me some days. As
deplorable as my condition is, it is still a great satisfaction
to me to think that the giant, though so
brutal and amorous, never used force to obtain that
which I always refused to his entreaties: not but
that he has threatened me a hundred times that he
would have recourse to the worst of extremities, in
case he could not otherwise prevail upon me; and, I
must confess to you, that a while ago, when I provoked
his anger by my words, I was less concerned
for my life than for my honour.</p>
<p>This, sir, said the prince of the Saracens&rsquo; wife, is
the faithful account of my misfortunes, and I do not
<span class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
question but that you will think me worthy enough
of your compassion, not to repent your having so generously
relieved me. Madam, answered my father,
be assured your troubles have moved me, and I will
do all that shall be in my power to make you happy
again. To-morrow, as soon as the day appears, we
will go out of this wood, and endeavour to fall into
the road which leads to the great city of Deryabar,
of which I am sovereign; and, if you think fit, you
shall be entertained in my palace, till the prince your
husband shall come to reclaim you.</p>
<p>The Saracen lady accepted the offer, and the next
day followed the king my father, who found all his
retinue upon the skirts of the wood, they having
spent the night in searching after, and being very
uneasy for that they could not find him. They were
no less joyful to meet their king, than amazed to see
him with a lady whose beauty surprised them. He
told them how he had found her, and the danger he
had run in drawing near to the hut, where he must
certainly have lost his life had the giant espied him.
One of his servants took up the lady behind him,
and another carried the child.</p>
<p>Thus they arrived at the king my father&rsquo;s palace,
who assigned the beautiful Saracen lady an apartment,
and caused the child to be carefully educated.
The lady was sensible of the king&rsquo;s goodness to her,
and expressed as much gratitude as he could desire.
She had at first appeared very uneasy and impatient,
on account that her husband did not reclaim her;
but by degrees she shook off that uneasiness: the
respect my father paid her dispelled her impatience;
and I am of opinion she would at last have blamed
fortune more for restoring her to her kindred than
she did for removing her from them.</p>
<p>In the mean time, the lady&rsquo;s son grew up; he was
<span class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
very handsome; and not wanting wit, found the way
to please the king my father, who had a great kindness
for him. All the courtiers perceived it, and
guessed that young man might in the end be my
husband. Upon this conceit, and looking on him
already as heir to the crown, they made their court
to him, and every man endeavoured to gain his favour.
He soon saw into their designs, grew conceited
of himself, and, forgetting the distance there
was between our conditions, flattered himself with
the hopes that my father was fond enough of him to
prefer him before all the princes in the world. Nay,
he went farther; for the king not answering his expectation,
in offering me to him as soon as he could
have wished, he had the boldness to ask me of him.
Whatsoever punishment his insolence deserved, my
father was satisfied with telling him that he had
other thoughts in relation to me, and showed him
no farther dislike. The youth was incensed at this
refusal; the vain fellow resented the contempt, as if
he had asked some maid of indifferent extraction, or
as if his birth had been equal to mine. Nor was he
so satisfied; but resolved to be revenged on the king;
and, with unparalleled ingratitude, conspired against
him. In short, he murdered him, and caused himself
to be proclaimed king of Deryabar, by a great
number of malcontents whom he supported. The
first thing he did, after ridding himself of my father,
was to come into my apartment with a great train of
the conspirators. His design was, either to take my
life or oblige me to marry him. While he was busy
murdering my father, the grand vizier, who had been
always loyal to his master, came to carry me away
from the palace, and secured me in a friend&rsquo;s house,
till a vessel he had provided was ready to sail. I
then left the island, attended only by a governess and
that generous minister, who chose rather to follow
<span class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
his master&rsquo;s daughter, and to partake of her misfortunes,
than to submit to a tyrant.</p>
<p>The grand vizier designed to carry me to the
courts of the neighbouring kings, to implore their
assistance, and excite them to revenge my father&rsquo;s
death; but Heaven did not give me a blessing to that
resolution we thought so just. When we had been
but a few days at sea, there arose such a furious
storm, that, in spite of all the mariners&rsquo; art, our vessel,
carried away by the violence of the winds and
waves, was dashed in pieces against a rock. I will
not spend time in describing our shipwreck. I can
but faintly represent to you how my governess, the
grand vizier, and all that attended me, were swallowed
up by the sea. The dread I was seized with
did not permit me to observe the horror of our condition.
In fine, I lost my senses; and whether I
was thrown upon the coast upon any part of the
wreck of our ship, or whether Heaven, which reserved
me for other misfortunes, wrought a miracle
in my deliverance, I found myself on shore when my
senses returned to me.</p>
<p>Misfortunes very often make us forget our duty:
instead of returning thanks to God for so singular a
mercy shown me, I only lifted up my eyes to heaven,
to complain because I had been saved. I was so far
from bewailing the vizier and my governess, that I
envied their fate; and, my dreadful imaginations by
degrees prevailing above my reason, I resolved to
cast myself into the sea. I was upon the point of
doing so, when I heard behind me a great noise of
men and horses. I looked about to see what it might
be, and spied several armed horsemen, among whom
was one mounted on an Arabian horse. He had on
a garment embroidered with silver, a girdle set with
precious stones, and a crown of gold on his head.
Though his habit had not convinced me that he was
<span class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
the chief of the company, I should have judged it by
the air of grandeur which appeared in his person.
He was a young man extraordinarily finely shaped, and
perfectly beautiful. Being surprised to see a young
lady alone in that place, he sent some of his officers
to ask who I was. All my answer was weeping. The
shore being covered with the wreck of our ship, they
concluded some vessel had been cast away there, and
that I was certainly some person that had saved my
life. This conjecture, and my inconsolable condition,
excited the curiosity of those officers, who began to
ask me a thousand questions, with assurances that
their king was a generous prince, and that I should
receive all comfort in his court.</p>
<p>The king, impatient to know who I was, grew
weary of expecting the return of his officers, and
drew near to me. He gazed on me very earnestly,
and, observing that I did not give over weeping and
afflicting myself, without being able to return an answer
to their questions, he forbade them troubling me
any more; and, directing his discourse to me, said,
Madam, I conjure you to moderate your excessive
affliction. Though Heaven in its wrath has laid this
calamity upon you, yet it does not behove you to
despair. I beseech you, show more courage: fortune,
which has hitherto persecuted you, is inconstant,
and may soon change. I dare assure you, that, if
your misfortunes are capable of receiving any comfort,
you shall find it in my dominions. My palace
is at your service: you shall live with the queen my
mother, who will endeavour by her kindness to ease
your affliction. I know not as yet who you are; but
I find I am already concerned for you.</p>
<p>I thanked the young king for his great goodness towards
me, accepted of the obliging offers he made me;
and, to convince him that I was not unworthy of him,
told him my condition. I described to him the insolence
<span class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
of the young Saracen, and found it needless to
do any more than barely to recount my misfortunes,
to excite compassion in him, and all his officers who
heard me. When I had done speaking, the prince
began again, assuring me that he was highly concerned
at my misfortune. Then he conducted me to his
palace, and presented me to the queen his mother, to
whom I was obliged again to repeat my misfortunes,
and to renew my tears. The queen seemed very sensible
of my troubles, and took an extraordinary liking
to me. On the other hand the king her son fell desperately
in love with me, and soon offered me his
person and his crown. I was still so entirely taken
up with the thoughts of my calamities, that the prince,
though so lovely a person, did not make so great an
impression on me as he might have done at another
time. However, gratitude prevailing on me, I did not
refuse to make him happy; and our wedding was kept
with all imaginable grandeur.</p>
<p>At the time when all the people were taken up with
the celebration of their sovereign&rsquo;s nuptials, a neighbouring
prince, who was his enemy, made a descent
by night on the island with a great number of troops.
That formidable enemy was the king Zanguebar: he
surprised those people, and cut to pieces all the king
my husband&rsquo;s subjects. We two escaped very narrowly,
for he had already entered the palace with some
of his followers; but we found means to slip away,
and got to the sea-coast, where we entered a fishing-boat
we had the good fortune to meet with. Two
days we were driven about by the winds, without
knowing what would become of us. The third day,
we spied a vessel making towards us with all her sails
aboard. We rejoiced at first, believing it had been
a merchant-ship which might take us aboard; but
were more astonished than I can express, when, as it
drew near, we saw ten or twelve armed pirates appear
<span class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
on the deck. Being come up to us, five or six of
them leaped into our boat, seized us, bound the prince,
and conveyed us into their ship, where they immediately
took off my veil. Instead of casting lots, every
one of them claimed the preference, and me as his
right. The controversy grew hot, and they came to
blows about me, and fought like so many madmen.
The deck was soon covered with dead bodies; and,
in short, they were all killed but one, who, being left
sole possessor of me, said, You are mine; I will carry
you to Grand Cairo, to deliver you to a friend of mine,
to whom I have promised a beautiful slave. But who,
added he, looking upon the king my husband, is that
man? What relation is he to you? Are you allied by
blood or love? Sir, answered I, he is my husband.
If so, replied the pirate, in pity I must rid myself of
him; it would be too great an affliction to him to see
you in my friend&rsquo;s arms. Having spoken these words,
he took up the unhappy prince, who was bound, and
threw him into the sea, notwithstanding all my endeavours
to hinder him.</p>
<p>I shrieked in a dreadful manner at the sight of that
cruel action, and had certainly cast myself headlong
into the sea, had not the pirate held me. He plainly
saw that was my design, and therefore bound me fast
to the main-mast, and then hoisting sail, made towards
the land, and there got ashore. He unbound
and led me to a little town, where he bought camels,
tents, and slaves, and then set out for Grand Cairo;
designing, as he still said, to present me to his friend,
according to his promise.</p>
<p>We had been several days upon the road, when, as
we were crossing this plain yesterday, we spied the
black who inhabited this castle. At a distance, we
took him for a tower; and, when near us, could scarce
believe him to be a man. He drew his vast scimitar,
and summoned the pirate to yield himself up a prisoner,
<span class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
with all his slaves, and the lady he was conducting.
The pirate was daring; and, being seconded
by all his slaves, who promised to stand by him,
he attacked the black. The fight lasted a considerable
time; but at length the pirate fell under the
enemy&rsquo;s deadly blows, as did all his slaves, who chose
rather to die than forsake him. The black then conducted
me to the castle, whither he also brought the
pirate&rsquo;s body, which he did eat that night for his supper.
After that inhuman meal, perceiving that I
ceased not weeping, he said to me, Young lady, prepare
to satisfy my desires, rather than continue thus
to afflict yourself. Make a virtue of necessity, and
comply: I give you till to-morrow to consider. Let
me then find you comforted for all your misfortunes,
and overjoyed for having been reserved for my bed.
Having spoken these words, he conducted me to a
chamber, and went to bed in his own, after locking up
all the castle-doors. He opened them this morning,
and presently locked them again, to pursue some travellers
he perceived at a distance; but it is likely
they made their escape, since he was coming alone,
and without any booty, when you attacked him.</p>
<p>As soon as the princess had put an end to the recital
of her adventures, Codadad declared to her that
he was highly concerned at her misfortunes. But,
madam, added he, it shall be your own fault if you do
not live at ease for the future: the king of Harran&rsquo;s
sons offer you a safe retreat in the court of the king
their father; be pleased to accept of it. You will be
there cherished by that prince, and respected by all
other persons; and, if you do not disdain the person
of your deliverer, permit me to make you a present of
it, and to marry you before all these princes: let them
be witnesses to our contract. The princess consented
to it, and the marriage was concluded that very day
in the castle, where they found all sorts of provisions.
<span class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
The kitchens were full of flesh and other eatables,
which the black used to feed on when he was weary of
feeding on human bodies. There was also a variety of
fruits, very excellent in their kinds, and, to complete
their satisfaction, abundance of delicious wine and
other liquors.</p>
<p>They all sat down to table; and, after having eaten
and drunk plentifully, they took along with them the
rest of the provisions, and set out for the king of Harran&rsquo;s
court. They travelled several days, encamping
in the pleasantest places they could find; and they
were within one day&rsquo;s journey of Harran, when, having
halted, and drunk all their wine, as being under
no longer concern to make it hold out, Codadad directed
his discourse to all his company thus: Princes,
I have too long concealed from you who I am. Behold
your brother Codadad! I have received my being,
as well as you, of the king of Harran. The prince
of Samaria has bred me, and the princess Pirouze is
my mother. Madam, added he, applying himself to
the princess of Deryabar, do you also forgive me, for
having concealed my birth from you. Perhaps, by
discovering it sooner, I might have prevented some
disagreeable reflections which may have been occasioned
by a match you may have thought unequal. No,
sir, answered the princess; the opinion I at first conceived
of you heightened every moment, and you did
not stand in need of the extraction you now discover,
to make me happy.</p>
<p>The princes congratulated Codadad on his birth,
and expressed much satisfaction at the knowledge of
it: but, in reality, instead of rejoicing, their hatred
for so amiable a brother was redoubled. They met
together at night in a by-place, whilst Codadad and
the princess his wife lay fast asleep in their tent.
Those ungrateful, envious brothers, forgetting that,
had it not been for the brave son of Pirouze, they must
<span class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
have been devoured by the black, agreed among themselves
to murder him. We have no other course to
choose, said one of those wicked brethren; for the
moment our father shall come to understand that this
stranger he is already so fond of is our brother, and
that he alone has been able to destroy a giant whom
we could not all of us together conquer, he will bestow
all his favour and a thousand praises on him,
and declare him his heir, in spite of all his brothers,
who will be obliged to obey and fall down before him.
Besides these, he added many other words, which
made such an impression on their jealous minds, that
they immediately repaired to Codadad, then fast
asleep, stabbed him in a thousand places, and leaving
him for dead in the arms of the princess of Deryabar,
proceeded on their journey for the city of Harran,
where they arrived the next day.</p>
<p>The king their father conceived the greater joy at
their return, because he had despaired of ever seeing
them. He asked what had been the occasion of their
stay; but they took care not to acquaint him with it,
making no mention either of the black or of Codadad;
and only said, that, being curious to see the country,
they had spent some time in the neighbouring cities.</p>
<p>In the mean time Codadad lay in his tent, drowned
in his own blood, and little differing from a dead man,
with the princess his wife, who seemed to be in no
much better condition than he. She rent the air with
her dismal shrieks, tore her hair, and, bathing her
husband&rsquo;s body with her tears, Alas! Codadad, my
dear Codadad, cried she, is it you whom I behold just
departing this life? What cruel hands have put you
into this condition? May I believe these are your brothers
who have treated you so unmercifully? No, they
are rather devils, who have taken those shapes to
murder you. O barbarous wretches! whosoever you
are, how could you make so ungrateful a return for
<span class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
the service he has done you? But why should I complain
of your brothers, unfortunate Codadad! I alone
am to blame for your death. You would tack your
fate upon mine; and all the ill fortune that attends
me since I left my father&rsquo;s palace has fallen upon you.
O Heaven! which has condemned me to lead a wandering
life and full of calamities, if you will not permit
me to have a consort, why do you permit me to
find any? Behold, you have now robbed me of two,
just as I began to be endeared to them.</p>
<p>By these, and other moving expressions, the unhappy
princess of Deryabar vented her sorrow, fixing
her eyes on the deplorable Codadad, who could not
hear her. But Codadad was not dead; and his consort,
observing that he still breathed, ran to a large
open town she spied in the plain, to inquire for a
surgeon. She was showed one, who went immediately
with her: but when they came to the tent, they
could not find Codadad, which made them conclude
he had been dragged away by some wild beast to devour
him. The princess renewed her complaints and
lamentations in a most dismal manner. The surgeon
took compassion; and, being unwilling to leave her in
that miserable condition, proposed to her to return
to the town, offering her his house and service.</p>
<p>She suffered herself to be prevailed on. The surgeon
conducted her to his house, and, without knowing
as yet who she was, treated her with all imaginable
courtesy and respect. He used all his rhetoric
to comfort her; but it was in vain to think of removing
her sorrow, which was rather heightened than
diminished. Madam, said he to her one day, be
pleased to recount to me your misfortunes; tell your
country and your condition: perhaps I may give you
some advice, when I am acquainted with all the circumstances
of your calamity. You do nothing but
<span class="pb" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
afflict yourself, without considering that remedies may
be found for the most desperate diseases.</p>
<p>The surgeon&rsquo;s words were so efficacious, that they
wrought on the princess, who recounted to him all her
adventures; and when she had done, the surgeon directed
his discourse to her, saying, Madam, since this
is the posture of affairs, give me leave to tell you, that
you ought not thus to give way to your sorrow; you
ought rather to arm yourself with resolution, and to
perform what the name and the duty of a wife require
of you. You are obliged to revenge your husband:
if you please I will wait on you as your squire: let
us go to the king of Harran&rsquo;s court; he is a good and
just prince: you need only represent to him, in a
lively manner, how prince Codadad has been treated
by his brothers: I am fully persuaded he will do you
justice. I submit to your reasons, answered the princess:
it is my duty to endeavour to revenge Codadad;
and since you are so obliging and generous as to offer
to bear me company, I am ready to set out. No
sooner had she fixed this resolution, than the surgeon
ordered two camels to be made ready, on which the
princess and he mounted, and repaired to Harran.</p>
<p>They alighted at the first caravansary they found;
and inquiring of the host what news at court, It is,
said he, in very great confusion. The king had a son,
who lived a long time with him as a stranger, and none
can tell what is become of that young prince. One of
the king&rsquo;s wives, called Pirouze, is his mother; she
has made all possible inquiry, but to no purpose. All
men are concerned at the loss of that prince, because
he was very deserving. The king has forty-nine other
sons, all of them born of several mothers; but not
one of them has worth enough to comfort the king
for the death of Codadad: I say his death, because
it is impossible he should be alive, since no news have
<span class="pb" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
been heard of him, notwithstanding so much search
has been made after him.</p>
<p>The surgeon, having heard this account from the
host, concluded that the best course the princess of
Deryabar could take, was to wait upon Pirouze: but
that method was not without some danger, and required
much precaution; for it was to be feared, that
if the king of Harran&rsquo;s sons should happen to hear of
the arrival of their sister-in-law, and her design, they
might cause her to be conveyed away before she could
speak to Codadad&rsquo;s mother. The surgeon weighed all
these particulars, and considered what risk he might
run himself; and therefore, that he might manage the
affair with discretion, he desired the princess to stay
in the caravansary, whilst he went to the palace to
observe which might be the safest way to conduct her
to Pirouze.</p>
<p>He went accordingly into the city, and was walking
towards the palace, like one led only by curiosity to
see the court, when he spied a lady mounted on a
mule richly accoutred. She was followed by several
ladies mounted on mules, with a great number of
guards and black slaves. All the people made a lane
to see her pass along, and saluted her, prostrating
themselves on the ground. The surgeon paid her the
same respect, and then asked a calendar, who happened
to stand by him, whether that lady was one of
the king&rsquo;s wives. Yes, brother, answered the calendar,
she is one of the king&rsquo;s wives, and the most
honoured and beloved by the people, because she is
mother to prince Codadad, of whom I suppose you
have heard.</p>
<p>The surgeon asked no more questions, but followed
Pirouze to a mosque, into which she went to distribute
alms, and assist at the public prayers the king
had ordered to be made for the safe return of Codadad.
The people, who were highly concerned for that young
<span class="pb" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
prince, ran in crowds to join their vows to the prayers
of the priests, so that the mosque was quite full. The
surgeon broke through the throng, and advanced as
far as Pirouze&rsquo;s guards. He staid out the prayers;
and when that princess went out, he stepped up to
one of her slaves, and whispered him in his ear, saying,
Brother, I have a secret of moment to impart to
the princess Pirouze; may not I, by your means, be
brought into her apartment? If that secret, answered
the slave, be relating to prince Codadad, I dare promise
you shall have audience of her this very day;
but if it concerns not him, it is needless for you to
endeavour to be introduced to her; for her thoughts
are all upon her son, and she will not hear talk of any
other subject. It is only about that dear son, replied
the surgeon, that I would discourse to her. If so,
said the slave, you need only follow us to the palace,
and you shall soon speak to her.</p>
<p>Accordingly, as soon as Pirouze was returned to her
apartment, that slave acquainted her that a person
unknown had some important affair to communicate
to her, and that it related to prince Codadad. No
sooner had he uttered these words, than Pirouze expressed
her impatience to see that stranger. The
slave immediately conducted him into the princess&rsquo;s
closet, who ordered all her women to withdraw, except
two, from whom she concealed nothing. As soon
as she saw the surgeon, she asked him abruptly what
news he had to tell her of Codadad. Madam, answered
the surgeon, after having prostrated himself on the
ground, I have a long account to give you, and such
as will be very surprising. Then he told her all the
particulars of what had passed between Codadad and
his brothers, which she listened to with an eager
attention; but when he came to speak of the murder,
that tender mother swooned away on her sofa, as if
she had been herself stabbed like her son. Her two
<span class="pb" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
women used proper means, and soon brought her to
herself. The surgeon continued his relation; and
when he had ended it, Pirouze said to him, Go back
to the princess of Deryabar, and assure her from me
that the king shall soon own her for his daughter-in-law;
and as for yourself, be assured that your service
shall be well rewarded.</p>
<p>When the surgeon was gone, Pirouze remained on
the sofa in such a state of affliction as is not easy to
imagine; and, relenting at the thoughts of Codadad,
O! my son, said she, I must never then expect to
see you more! Alas! when I gave you leave to depart
from Samaria, and you took leave of me, I did not
imagine that so unfortunate a death had awaited you
at such a distance from me. Unfortunate Codadad!
why did you leave me? It is true, you would not
have acquired so much renown; but you had been
still alive, and had not cost your mother so many tears.
Whilst she uttered these words, she wept bitterly,
and her two confidants, moved by her sorrow, mixed
their tears with hers.</p>
<p>Whilst they were all three in that affliction, the
king came into the closet, and seeing them in that
condition, asked Pirouze whether she had received
any bad news concerning Codadad. Alas! sir, said
she, all is over; my son has lost his life; and, to add
to my sorrow, I cannot pay him the funeral rites; for,
in all appearance, the wild beasts have devoured him.
Then she told him all that she had heard from the
surgeon, and did not fail to express herself fully at the
inhuman manner in which Codadad had been murdered
by his brothers.</p>
<p>The king did not give Pirouze time to finish her relation;
but, being transported with anger, and giving
way to his passion, Madam, said he to the princess,
those perfidious wretches who cause you to shed these
tears, and are the occasion of the mortal grief which
<span class="pb" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
oppresses their father, shall soon feel the punishment
due to their guilt. The king having spoken these
words, with indignation appearing in his countenance,
went directly to the presence-chamber, where all his
courtiers attended, and such of the people as had any
petitions to present to him. They were all astonished
to see him in that passion, and thought his anger had
been kindled against his people.</p>
<p>Their hearts failed them for fear. He ascended
the throne, and causing the grand vizier to draw near,
said, Hassan, I have some orders for you: go immediately,
take a thousand of my guards, and seize all
the princes my sons; shut them up in the tower appointed
for a prison for murderers; and let this be
done in a moment. All that were present quaked at
the hearing of this surprising command; and the grand
vizier, without answering one word, laid his hand on
his head, to express his obedience, and went out of the
presence to execute his orders, which were very surprising
to him. In the mean time, the king dismissed
those who attended to desire audience, and declared
he would not despatch any business for a month to
come. He was still in the presence-chamber, when
the vizier returned. Are all my sons, said that prince,
in the tower? They are, sir, answered the vizier; I
have obeyed your orders. This is not all, replied the
king, I have farther commands for you; and so saying,
he went out of the presence-chamber, and returned
to Pirouze&rsquo;s apartment, with the vizier following
him. He asked that princess where Codadad&rsquo;s
widow had taken up her lodging. Pirouze&rsquo;s women
told him; for the surgeon had not forgot that in his
relation. Then the king, turning to his minister, Go,
said he, to that caravansary, and bring a young princess,
who lodges there; but treat her with all the respect
due to her quality.</p>
<p>The vizier was not backward in performing what
<span class="pb" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
he was ordered. He mounted on horseback, with all
the emirs and courtiers, and repaired to the caravansary
where the princess of Deryabar was, whom he
acquainted with his orders, and presented her, from
the king, a fine white mule, whose saddle and bridle
were adorned with gold, rubies, and diamonds. She
mounted it, and went to the palace, attended by all
those great men. The surgeon bore her company,
mounted on a sprightly Tartar horse which the vizier
had provided for him. All the people were at their
windows, or in the streets, to see that noble cavalcade;
and it being given out that the princess, whom
they conducted in such state to court, was Codadad&rsquo;s
wife, the city resounded with acclamations, the air
rang with shouts of joy, which would certainly have
been turned into lamentations, had that prince&rsquo;s fatal
adventure been known; so much was he beloved by
all men.</p>
<p>The princess of Deryabar found the king at the
palace gate, waiting to receive her. He took her by
the hand, and led her to Pirouze&rsquo;s apartment, where
a very moving scene was acted among them. Codadad&rsquo;s
wife found her affliction redouble upon her at
the sight of her husband&rsquo;s father and mother; as, on
the other side, those parents could not look on their
son&rsquo;s wife without being much concerned. She cast
herself at the king&rsquo;s feet, and having bathed them with
tears, was so overcome with grief, that she was not
able to speak one word. Pirouze was in no better
condition; she seemed to be stunned with her sorrows;
and the king, moved by those dismal objects, gave
way to his passion: those three persons, mixing their
tears and sighs, for some time observed a silence,
which appeared extraordinary moving and pitiful. At
length the princess of Deryabar, being somewhat recovered,
recounted the adventure of the castle and
Codadad&rsquo;s disaster. Then she required justice for
<span class="pb" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
the treachery of the princes. Yes, madam, said the
king to her, those ungrateful wretches shall perish,
but Codadad&rsquo;s death must first be made public, that
the punishment of his brothers may not cause my subjects
to rebel; and, though we have not my son&rsquo;s
body, we will not omit paying him the last duties.
This said, he directed his discourse to the vizier, and
ordered him to build a dome of white marble in a delightful
plain, in the midst of which the city of Harran
stands; then he appointed the princess of Deryabar a
fine apartment in his palace, acknowledging her for
his daughter-in-law.</p>
<p>Hassan caused the work to be carried on with such
diligence, and employed so many workmen, that the
dome was soon finished. Within it was erected a
monument, and on it was placed a figure representing
Codadad. As soon as all was perfected, the king
ordered prayers to be said, and appointed a day for the
obsequies of his son.</p>
<p>On that day, all the inhabitants of the city went
out upon the plain to see that ceremony performed;
which was after this manner. The king, attended by
his vizier and the prime persons of the court, proceeded
towards the dome; and being come to it, went
in, and sat down with them on carpets laid on the
ground, made of black satin, with gold flowers. A
great body of horse guards, hanging their heads, and
looking down, drew up close about the dome, and
marched round it twice, observing a profound silence;
but at the third round, they halted before the door,
and all of them with a loud voice pronounced these
words: &lsquo;O prince, son to the king, could we by dint
of sword and human valour any way retrieve your
misfortune, we would bring you back to life; but the
King of kings has commanded, and the angel of death
has obeyed.&rsquo; Having uttered these words, they drew
off, to make way for a hundred old men, all of them
<span class="pb" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
mounted on black mules, and wearing long gray
beards.</p>
<p>These were anchorites, who lived all their days
concealed in caves. They never appeared in the sight
of the world, but when they were to assist at the obsequies
of the kings of Harran, and of the princes of
their family. Each of these venerable persons carried
a book on his head, which he held with one hand.
They took three turns round the dome without uttering
one word; then stopping before the door, one of
them said, &lsquo;O prince, what can we do for you? If
you could be restored to life by prayers or learning,
we would rub our gray beards at thy feet, and recite
prayers; but the King of the universe has taken you
away for ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This said, the old men removed at a distance from
the dome, and immediately fifty young beautiful maids
drew near to it: each of them was mounted on a little
white horse: they wore no veils, and carried gold
baskets full of all sorts of precious stones. Thus
they did also ride thrice round the dome; and, halting
at the same place as the others had done, the
youngest of them spoke in the name of all as follows:
&lsquo;O prince, once so beautiful, what relief can you expect
from us? If we could restore you to life by our
charms, we would become your slaves. But you are
no longer sensible to beauty, and have no more occasion
for us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the young maids were withdrawn, the king
and his courtiers arose, and, having walked thrice
round the figure representing Codadad, the king spoke
as follows: &lsquo;O my dear son, light of my eyes, I have
then lost thee for ever.&rsquo; These words were attended
with sighs, and he watered the tomb with his tears,
his courtiers weeping with him. Then the gate of the
dome was shut, and all the people returned to the city.
The next day, there were public prayers in all the
<span class="pb" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
mosques; and the same was continued for eight days
successively. On the ninth, the king resolved to cause
the princes his sons to be beheaded. All the people,
being incensed at their cruelty towards Codadad, impatiently
expected to see them executed. The scaffolds
were erecting; but the execution was respited, on account
that, on a sudden, news was brought, that the
neighbouring princes, who had before made war on the
king of Harran, were advancing with more numerous
forces than the first time, and were not then far from
the city. It had been long known that they were preparing
for war, but no great notice had been taken of
it. This advice occasioned a general consternation,
and gave new cause to lament the loss of Codadad,
by reason that prince had signalized himself in the
former war against those enemies. Alas! said they,
were the brave Codadad alive, we should little value
those princes who are coming to surprise us. The
king, nothing dismayed, raised men with all possible
speed, formed a considerable army, and, being too
brave to expect the enemy to come and attack him
within his walls, marched out to meet them. They,
on their side, being informed by their advanced parties
that the king of Harran was marching to engage them,
halted in the plain, and formed their army.</p>
<p>As soon as the king discovered them, he also drew
up his forces, and ranged them in order of battle. The
signal was given, and he attacked them with extraordinary
vigour. Nor was the opposition inferior: much
blood was shed on both sides, and the victory remained
long dubious; but at length it seemed to incline to
the king of Harran&rsquo;s enemies, who, being more numerous,
were about hemming him in, when a good
body of horse appeared on the plain, and drew near
the two armies in good order. The sight of that fresh
party daunted both sides, as not knowing what to
think of them. But their doubts were soon cleared;
<span class="pb" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
for those horsemen fell upon the flank of the king of
Harran&rsquo;s enemies, giving such a furious charge, that
they soon broke and put them to the rout; and, not
so satisfied, they pursued them, and cut most of them
in pieces.</p>
<p>The king of Harran, who had nicely observed all
the action, admired the bravery of those horsemen,
whose unexpected arrival had given the victory to his
side. But, above all, he was charmed with their chief,
whom he had seen fighting with a more than ordinary
valour. He longed to know the name of that generous
hero. Being impatient to see and thank him, he
advanced towards him, but perceived he was coming
to prevent him. The two princes drew near, and
the king of Harran finding Codadad in that brave
warrior who had just then succoured him, or rather
defeated his enemies, became motionless with joy
and surprise. Sir, said Codadad to him, you have
sufficient cause to be astonished, seeing a man appear
on a sudden before your majesty whom perhaps you
concluded to be dead. I should have been so, had
not Heaven preserved me still against your enemies.
O my son! cried the king, is it possible that you are
restored to me? Alas! I despaired of seeing you any
more. Having so said, he stretched out his arms to
the young prince, who flew to his loving embraces.</p>
<p>I know all, my son, said the king again, after having
long held him in his arms; I know what return
my sons have made you for the service you did in delivering
them out of the hands of the black; but you
shall be revenged to-morrow. Let us now go to the
palace; your mother, who has wept sufficiently for
you, expects me, to rejoice with us for the defeat of
our enemies. What a joy will it be to her to be informed
that my victory is your handy-work! Sir, said
Codadad, give me leave to ask you, how could you
<span class="pb" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
come to know the adventure of the castle? Has any
of my brothers, repenting, owned the thing to you?
No, answered the king, the princess of Deryabar has
given us an account of all things; for she is in my
palace, and came thither to demand justice against
your brothers. Codadad was in a transport of joy to
understand that the princess his wife was at the court.
Let us go, sir, cried he to his father in a rapture, let
us go to see my mother, who waits for us. I have
an ardent desire to dry up her tears, as well as those
of the princess of Deryabar.</p>
<p>The king immediately returned to the city, with
his army, which he dismissed; entering his palace
victorious, amidst the acclamations of his people, who
followed him in crowds, praying to Heaven to prolong
his life, and extolling Codadad to the skies. These
two princes found Pirouze and her daughter-in-law
waiting for the king to congratulate him; but there
is no expressing the transport of joy they felt when
they saw the young prince come with him: they dissolved
in embraces, mixed with tears, but of a different
sort from those they had before shed for him. When
these four persons had performed all that the ties of
blood and love demanded of them, the question was
asked of Pirouze&rsquo;s son, by what miracle he came to
be still alive. He answered, that a peasant, mounted
on a mule, happening accidentally to come into the
tent where he lay senseless, and perceiving him alone,
and stabbed in several places, had made him fast on
his mule, and carried him to his house, where he applied
to his wounds certain herbs chewed, which had
recovered him in a few days. When I found myself
well, added he, I returned thanks to the peasant, and
gave him all the diamonds I had. Then I drew near
the city of Harran; but being informed by the way
that some neighbouring princes had gathered forces,
<span class="pb" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
and were coming to fall upon the king&rsquo;s subjects, I
made myself known unto the villagers, and stirred up
those people to stand upon their guard. I armed a
good number of young men; and heading them, happened
to come in at that time when the two armies
were engaged.</p>
<p>When he had done speaking, the king said, Let us
return thanks to God for having preserved Codadad;
but it is requisite that the traitors, who would have
destroyed him, should perish this day. Sir, answered
the generous son of Pirouze, though they are wicked
and ungrateful, consider they are your own flesh and
blood: they are my brothers; I forgive them the
offence, and beg pardon of you for them. This generosity
drew tears from the king, who caused the
people to be assembled, and declared Codadad his heir.
Then he ordered the princes, who were prisoners, to
be brought, loaded with irons. Pirouze&rsquo;s son knocked
off their chains, and embraced them all successively,
with as much sincerity as he had done in the court
of the black&rsquo;s castle. The people were charmed with
Codadad&rsquo;s good nature, and highly applauded him.
Next he nobly rewarded the surgeon, to requite the
service he had done the princess of Deryabar.</p>
<p>The sultaness Scheherazade, having told the story
of Ganem with so much address, and in so agreeable
a manner, that the sultan of the Indies could not
forbear showing the pleasure that relation gave him,
said to that monarch, I doubt not but your majesty
is very well satisfied to find the caliph Haroun Alraschid
change his sentiments in favour of Ganem, his
mother, and sister; and I believe you may be sensibly
affected with their misfortunes, and the ill treatment
they received; but am persuaded, if your majesty
would hear the story of the Sleeper Awakened,
it would, instead of exciting all those emotions of
<span class="pb" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
indignation and compassion in your breast, on the
contrary, afford you all the mirth and diversion imaginable.
The sultan, who promised himself some
new adventures from the title of that story, would
have heard it that morning; but perceiving day approached,
deferred it till next, when Dinarzade called
upon her sister, who began her story as follows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">[269]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><br />THE STORY OF
<br />THE SLEEPER AWAKENED.</h2>
<p>In the reign of caliph Haroun Alraschid, there
lived at Bagdad a very rich merchant, who, having
married a woman pretty well in years, had but one
son, whom he named Abon Hassan, and educated
with great restraint. When this son was thirty years
old, the merchant died, and left him his sole heir, and
master of great riches, which his father had amassed
together by his industry, frugality, and great application
to business.</p>
<p>Abon Hassan, whose views and inclinations were
very much different from those of his father, was resolved
to make another use of his wealth; for, as his
father had never allowed him any money but what
was just necessary for subsistence, and he had always
envied those young persons of his age who wanted
none, and who debarred themselves from none of
those pleasures to which youth are too much addicted,
he resolved, in his turn, to signalize himself by extravagances
proportionable to his fortune. To this
end, he divided his riches in two parts; with one half
he bought houses in town and land in the country,
with a promise to himself never to touch the income
of his estate, which was considerable enough to live
upon very handsomely, but lay it all by; with the
other half, which he kept by him in ready money, he
designed to make himself amends for the time he had
lost in the severe restraint with which his father had
always kept him.</p>
<p>With this intent, Abon Hassan associated himself
in a few days with people of his age and condition,
<span class="pb" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
and thought of nothing more than how to spend their
time agreeably. Every day he gave them splendid
entertainments, at which the most exquisite and delicate
wines flowed in plenty, while concerts of the
best vocal and instrumental music heightened their
pleasures; and then this young band of debauchees,
with glasses in their hands, sang and joined with the
music; and these feasts generally ended with balls at
night, to which the best dancers in Bagdad, of both
sexes, were invited. These entertainments, renewed
every day, were so expensive to Abon Hassan, that
he could not support the extravagance above one year;
and, in short, the great sum which he had consecrated
to this prodigality and the year ended together. As
soon as he left off keeping this table, his friends forsook
him: whenever they saw him, they avoided him;
and if by chance he met any of them, and would stop
them, they always excused themselves on some pretence
or other.</p>
<p>Abon Hassan, touched more to the quick at this
strange behaviour of his friends, who had forsaken
him so basely and ungratefully, after all the protestations
of friendship they had made him, and
their inviolable attachment to his service, than all the
money he had foolishly squandered away, went, melancholy
and thoughtful, into his mother&rsquo;s apartment,
and sat down on a sofa a good distance from her.
What is the matter with you, son? said his mother,
reading his grief in his countenance: why are you so
altered, so dejected, and so much different from yourself?
You could not certainly be more concerned if
you had lost all you had in the world. I know you
have lived very profusely, and believe all your money
is spent; yet you have a good estate; and the reason
I did not so very much oppose your irregular way of
living, was, I knew the wise precaution you had taken
to preserve half your substance; therefore I do not
<span class="pb" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
see why you should plunge yourself into this deep
melancholy.</p>
<p>At these words, Abon Hassan melted into tears,
and in the midst of his sighs cried out, Ah! mother,
I see at last, by sad experience, how insupportable
poverty is: I am sensible that it deprives us of joy, as
much as the setting sun does of light. In poverty,
we have no commendations and fine things said unto
us: we endeavour to conceal all our actions, and spend
our nights in tears and sorrow. In short, a poor man
is looked upon, both by friends and relations, as a
stranger. You know, mother, how I have used my
friends for this year past: I have entertained them
with all imaginable generosity, till I have spent all
my money; and now they have left me, when I can
treat them no longer. For my estate, I thank Heaven
for having given me the grace to keep the oath I have
made not to enter upon that; and now I shall know
how to make a good use of it. But first, I will try
the gratitude of friends, who deserve not that I
should call them so: I will go to them one after
another, and when I have represented to them what
I have done for their sakes, I will ask them to make
me up a sum of money among them, to relieve me out
of the miserable condition I am reduced to: these
are the steps I intend to take to try their gratitude.</p>
<p>I do not pretend, son, said Abon Hassan&rsquo;s mother,
to dissuade you from executing your design; but I
can tell you before-hand, that you have no ground for
any hope: believe me, you will find no relief, but
from the estate you have reserved. I see you do not,
but will soon know those people, whom we generally
call friends; and I wish to Heaven you may, in the
manner I desire; that is to say, for your own good.
Mother, replied Abon Hassan, I am persuaded of the
truth of what you say; but shall be certain of a fact
which concerns me so nearly, when I shall inform
<span class="pb" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
myself better of their baseness. Upon this, Abon Hassan
went immediately to his friends, whom he found
at home, represented to them the great need he was
in, and begged of them to loose their purse-strings to
assist him. He promised to give every one bonds to
pay them the money they lent him, as soon as his
affairs were made up; giving them to understand, at
the same time, that it was, in a great measure, upon
their accounts that he was undone; and forgetting
not to allure them with the hopes of being once again
entertained in the same manner as before.</p>
<p>Not one of his bottle companions was affected
with the arguments which the afflicted Abon Hassan
made use of to persuade them; and he had the mortification
to find, that many of them told him plainly
they scarce knew him.</p>
<p>He returned home again full of grief and rage;
and, going into his mother&rsquo;s apartment, said, Ah!
madam, you was in the right of it; instead of friends,
I have found none but ungrateful, perfidious wretches,
who deserve not my friendship; whom I renounce,
and promise never to see them more. He resolved to
be as good as his word; and, to that end, took all
possible precautions to avoid falling into the same
inconvenience, taking an oath never to give an inhabitant
of Bagdad any entertainment again. Afterwards
he opened a strong chest, in which he had put
the rents he had received from his estate, and resolved
to take every day a sum that was sufficient to
defray the expense of a single person to sup with
him; who, according to the oath he had taken, must
be a stranger that came into Bagdad the same day,
and must take his leave of him the next morning.</p>
<p>According to this project, Abon Hassan took care
every morning to provide whatever he designed for
night, and towards the close of the evening went and
sat on Bagdad bridge; and, as soon as ever he saw a
<span class="pb" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
stranger, of whatever condition he was, he accosted
him civilly, and invited him to sup and lodge with him
that night; and, after having informed him of the law
he had imposed upon himself, took him home with
him. The repast with which Abon Hassan regaled
his guests was not costly, but always plain and neat,
with plenty of good wine, and generally lasted till the
night was pretty well advanced; when, instead of
entertaining his guest with the affairs of state, his
family or business, as is too frequent, he affected to
talk of indifferent subjects, and was naturally of so
gay and pleasant a temper, that he could give the
most agreeable turns in conversation, and make the
most reserved and melancholy persons merry. When
he saw his guest again the next morning, he always
said to him, God preserve you from all sorrow
wherever you go: when I invited you yesterday to
come and sup with me, I informed you of the law I
have made; therefore do not take it ill if I tell you
that we must never see one another again, nor drink
together, for reasons best known to myself: so God
conduct you.</p>
<p>Abon Hassan was very exact in the observation of
this oath, and never looked upon, or spoke to, any
stranger he had once entertained, wherever he met
them; and had lived for a long time after this manner,
when one afternoon, a little before sunset, as he
was sitting upon the bridge, according to custom, the
caliph Haroun Alraschid came by so disguised that
nobody could know him: for that monarch, though
his chief ministers and officers of justice acquitted
themselves of their duty very punctually, yet would
take notice of every thing himself; and, to that purpose,
often disguised himself, and walked through the
city and suburbs of Bagdad; and that day was dressed
like a merchant of Moussel, who had but just disembarked,
and was followed by a slave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">[274]</div>
<p>As the caliph had in his disguise a grave and awful
air, Abon Hassan, who thought him to be a Moussel
merchant, went directly to him; and, after having
saluted him with a smiling countenance, and kissed
his hand, said, Sir, I congratulate you on your happy
arrival, and beg of you to do me the honour to go and
sup with me, and repose yourself at my home this
night, after the fatigue of your voyage; and, to oblige
him not to deny him that favour, he told him his custom
of entertaining the first stranger he met with.
The caliph found something so odd and singular in
Abon Hassan&rsquo;s taste, that he was very desirous to
know the bottom, without quitting the character of a
merchant; and told him, that he could not better
answer that great civility, which he did not expect
at his arrival at Bagdad, than by accepting the obliging
offer that he made him.</p>
<p>Abon Hassan, who knew not that the guest which
fortune presented to him was so very much above
him, treated him as his equal, carried him home, and
led him into a room very neatly furnished, where he
set him on a sofa, at the upper end of a table that was
ready laid for supper, which was soon after sent up
by Abon Hassan&rsquo;s mother, who took upon herself the
care of the kitchen, and consisted of three dishes.
The first was a capon and four large pullets, which
were set in the middle; and the second and third,
placed on each side, were a fat roasted goose and
boiled pigeons, all dressed very neatly, and with proper
sauces.</p>
<p>Abon Hassan sat down over against his guest, and
he and the caliph began to eat heartily of what they
liked best, without speaking or drinking, according to
the custom of the country. When they had done eating,
the caliph&rsquo;s slave brought them water to wash
their hands; and, in the mean time, Abon Hassan&rsquo;s
mother sent up a dessert of all sorts of dried sweetmeats,
<span class="pb" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
and all the fruits then in season, as grapes,
peaches, apples, pears, &amp;c. As soon as it grew dark,
wax-candles were lighted, and Abon Hassan, after
charging his mother to take care of the caliph&rsquo;s slave,
brought bottles and glasses.</p>
<p>Then Abon Hassan, sitting down with the pretended
Moussel merchant again, filled out a glass of
wine, before he touched the dessert; and holding it
out in his hand, said to the caliph, You know, sir,
that the cock never drinks before he calls to his hens
to come and drink with him; so I invite you to follow
my example. I do not know what you may think;
for my part, I cannot reckon him a wise man who
does not love wine: come, let us leave those sort of
people to their dull melancholy humours, and seek
for mirth, which is only to be found in a brimmer.</p>
<p>While Abon Hassan was drinking, the caliph, taking
the glass that was set by him, said, Now I like
you, you are an honest fellow; I am mightily taken
with your pleasant temper, and expect you should fill
me as much. Abon Hassan, as soon as he had drunk,
filled the caliph&rsquo;s glass, and giving it to him, Here,
sir, said he, taste this wine; I will warrant it good. I
am very well persuaded, replied the caliph, laughing,
that you know how to make choice of the best. O,
replied Abon Hassan, while the caliph was taking off
his glass, one may easily find that you know what
good living is, and have seen the world. Alas! how
happy is my house in your presence, and how overjoyed
am I for meeting with a man of so much merit.</p>
<p>The caliph, who was naturally a merry man, was
mightily diverted with these sallies of Abon Hassan,
and took great pleasure in promoting drinking, often
asking for wine, thinking that when that began to
work, he might penetrate so far into his discourse as
to satisfy his curiosity. Therefore, to enter into conversation,
he asked him his name, his business, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
how he spent his life. My name, sir, replied he, is
Abon Hassan: my father, whom I buried, was a
merchant of Bagdad; and though he was not the
richest, yet he lived very well. When he died, he
left me enough in my station to live free from ambition;
but as he always kept a very strict hand over
me in his life-time, I was willing, when he was gone,
to make up the time I thought I had lost.</p>
<p>But notwithstanding, continued Abon Hassan, in
this I was more prudent than most young people are,
who give themselves unto debauchery without any
thought, and who reduce themselves to the utmost
poverty, and are forced to do penance all the rest of
their lives after. Now I, to avoid this misfortune,
divided what I had left me in two parts, and with one
bought an estate, with a resolution not to finger my
rents at that time; and kept the other in ready money
to pursue my extravagances with. I associated
myself with young people of my age, and with my
ready money, which I spent profusely, treated them
every day; and, in short, spared for no sort of pleasure.
But these feastings did not last long; for by
that time the year was out, I had got to the bottom of
my cash, and then all my friends vanished. I made a
visit to every one of them, and represented to them
the miserable condition I was in, but none of them
would relieve me. Upon this, I renounced their
friendship, and retrenched so far as to live within the
compass of my income, and obliged myself to keep
company with none but the first stranger I could meet
with, coming that day into Bagdad, and to entertain
him but one night. I have told you the rest before;
and I thank my good fortune this day for meeting with
a stranger of so much worth.</p>
<p>The caliph was very well satisfied with this information,
and said to Abon Hassan, I cannot enough
commend the measures you have taken, and the prudence
<span class="pb" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
with which you have acted, by forsaking your
debauchery; a conduct rarely to be met with in
young persons; and I esteem you the more for being
so just to yourself as you have been. It was a slippery
path you trode in; and I cannot enough admire,
how, after having seen the end of your ready money,
you had so great a command over yourself not to
enter upon your estate. In short, I must own I envy
your happiness: you are the only happy man in the
world, to enjoy every day the company of some one
honest man, with whom you can discourse freely and
agreeably, and to whom you give an opportunity to
declare, wherever he goes, how handsomely he was
received by you. But we talk too long without drinking;
come drink, and pour out to me.</p>
<p>In this manner the caliph and Abon Hassan entertained
each other, drinking and talking of indifferent
matters till the night was pretty far advanced; when
the caliph, pretending to be fatigued after his voyage,
told his host he stood in need of a little rest; but,
added he, that I may not deprive you of yours, before
we part, because to-morrow I may be gone before
you are stirring, I would be glad to show you how
sensible I am of your civility, and the kind and obliging
hospitality you have shown me. The only thing
that troubles me is, that I know not which way to
pay my acknowledgment; therefore I beg of you to
let me understand how I may, and you shall see I
will not be ungrateful; for certainly you must have
some business in which you may be served, or must
want something which you could wish for. Speak
freely, and declare your mind; for, though I am but
a merchant, it may be in mine or some friend&rsquo;s power
to oblige you.</p>
<p>To these offers of the caliph, Abon Hassan, taking
him still for a Moussel merchant, replied, I am very
well persuaded, good sir, that it is not out of a compliment
<span class="pb" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
that you make me these generous tenders;
but, upon the word of an honest man, I have nothing
that troubles me, no business nor desires, and want
not any thing. I have not the least ambition, as I
told you before, but am very well satisfied with my
condition. Therefore, I can only thank you for your
obliging proffers, and the honour you have done me
to come and take a slight repast with me. Yet I
must tell you, pursued Abon Hassan, there is one
thing gives me great uneasiness. You know the town
of Bagdad is divided into several parts and divisions,
to each of which there belongs a mosque, and an iman
to read prayers at certain hours. The iman of the
division I live in is an old man, of an austere countenance,
and the greatest hypocrite in the world.
This man, and four old men of this neighbourhood,
who are people of the same stamp, meet every day at
the iman&rsquo;s house; there they vent their slander, calumny,
and malice against me and the whole division,
to the disturbance of the public peace of the neighbourhood,
and the promotion of dissension. Some they
threaten, others they rail against; and, in short,
would be lords paramount, and have every one govern
himself according to their caprice; and, at the same
time, know not how to govern themselves. Indeed,
I would have them meddle with nothing but their
Alcoran, and let the world live quietly.</p>
<p>Well, I suppose, said the caliph, you would willingly
put a stop to this disorder. You have guessed
it, answered Abon Hassan; and the only thing I
should desire, would be to be caliph only for one day,
in the stead of our sovereign lord and master Haroun
Alraschid, the commander of the faithful. What
would you do if you were? said the caliph. I would
make them examples, answered Abon Hassan, to the
satisfaction of all honest men. I would punish the
four old men with each a hundred bastinadoes on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
soles of their feet, and the iman with four hundred, to
learn them not to disturb and abuse their neighbours
any more.</p>
<p>The caliph was extremely well pleased with this
thought of Abon Hassan&rsquo;s; and, as he was a prince
who loved adventures, he fancied to make this a very
singular one. Indeed, said he, I approve very much of
your wish, which I see proceeds from an upright mind,
that cannot bear to see the malice of wicked people
go unpunished. I could like to see it take effect, and
that is not so impossible a thing as you imagine. I
am persuaded that the caliph would willingly put his
authority for twenty-four hours into your hands, if he
knew your good intentions, and the just use you
would make of it. I see, said Abon Hassan, you
laugh at my foolish fancy; and the caliph himself
would laugh at my extravagance too if he knew it;
but yet it would be a means of informing him of the
iman&rsquo;s and his companions&rsquo; behaviour, and he might
chastise them.</p>
<p>Heaven forbid, replied the caliph, that I, who have
been so handsomely entertained by you, should laugh
at you; neither do I believe, as much a stranger as I
am, that the caliph would be displeased. But let us
lay this discourse aside; it is almost midnight, and
time to go to bed. With all my heart, said Abon
Hassan, I would not be any hindrance to your going
to rest; but there is still some wine in the bottle, and,
if you please, we will drink it off first. The only
thing that I have to recommend to you is, that, when
you go out in the morning, if I am not up, you will
give yourself the trouble of shutting the door after
you, which the caliph promised; and while Abon
Hassan was talking, took the bottle and two glasses,
and filled his own first, saying, Here is a cup of thanks
to you; and then filling the other, put artfully a little
<span class="pb" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
powder, which he had about him, into it, and giving
it to Abon Hassan, said, you have taken the pains to
fill for me all this night, and it is the least I can do
to save you the trouble once; come, drink to our
good repose.</p>
<p>Abon Hassan took the glass, and, to show his guest
with how much pleasure he received the honour he
did him, whipped it off at once; but had scarcely set
the glass upon the table before the powder began to
work, and he fell into so sound a sleep, that his head
knocked against his knees. The caliph ordered the
slave that he had brought along with him, and who
came again into the room as soon as he had supped,
to take him upon his back, and follow him; but to be
sure to observe the house, that he might know it
again when he should bring him back; and in this
manner the caliph, followed by the slave with Abon
Hassan on his back, went out of the house, but without
shutting the door after him, as Abon Hassan desired,
and went directly to his palace, and, by a backdoor,
into his own apartment, where all the officers of
his apartment were waiting for him, whom he ordered
to undress him, and put him in his bed, which
they immediately performed.</p>
<p>Then the caliph sent for all the officers and ladies
of the palace, and said to them, I would have all those
whose business it is to attend my levee wait to-morrow
morning upon this man who lies in my bed, and
pay the same respect to him as to myself, and obey
him in whatever he commands; let him be refused in
nothing that he asks for, and be spoken to and answered
in every thing he says or does, as if he was
the commander of the faithful. In short, I expect
you to look upon him as the true caliph, and neglect
not the least circumstance.</p>
<p>The officers and ladies presently understood that
<span class="pb" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
the caliph had a mind to divert himself, and made
low bows to show their obedience, and then withdrew,
every one full of the part they were to act.</p>
<p>Then he sent for the grand vizier: Giafar, said he,
I have sent for you to instruct you, and to prevent
your being surprised to-morrow when you come to an
audience, to see this man, that is laid here in my bed,
seated on my throne in my royal robes: accost him
with the same reverence and respect you pay to myself;
observe, and punctually execute, whatever he
bids you do, the same as if I commanded you, even if
his liberality should extend so far as to empty all the
coffers in my treasury; and remember to acquaint all
my emirs and huissirs, all the officers without the palace,
to pay him the same honour at audience as the
commander of the believers himself; and to carry on
the matter so well, that he might not perceive the
least thing that may interrupt this joke which I am
diverting myself with.</p>
<p>Afterwards the grand vizier retired, and the caliph
went to bed in another apartment; and ordered Mesrour,
the chief of his eunuchs, to take care to manage
things so well, that he might see how Abon Hassan
would use the power and authority of the caliph for
the time he desired to have it; and, above all, charged
him to awake him at the usual hour, before he awakened
Abon Hassan, because he had a mind to be present
when he rose.</p>
<p>Mesrour failed not to do as the caliph had commanded;
and, as soon as the caliph went into the
room where Abon Hassan lay, he placed himself in a
little closet, from whence he could see all that passed.
All the officers and ladies who were to attend Abon
Hassan&rsquo;s levee, took their posts according to their
rank, with great silence, and discharged themselves
as punctually of their offices as if the caliph had been
to rise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">[282]</div>
<p>As it was just day-break, and time to rise to morning
prayer before sun-rise, the officer that stood
nearest to the head of the bed, put a sponge steeped
in vinegar to Abon Hassan&rsquo;s nose; who, presently
turning his head about without opening his eyes,
sneezed heartily, which was generally the effect of
the caliph&rsquo;s powder, and which lasted longer or
shorter in proportion to the dose. Then opening his
eyes, he found himself, by the small light that appeared,
in a stately room magnificently furnished, the
ceiling of which was finely painted, and the floor covered
with a rich silk tapestry, and surrounded by a
great many young and handsome ladies, with all sorts
of instruments of music in their hands, and black eunuchs
richly clothed, all standing with great modesty
and respect. After casting his eyes on the quilt of
the bed, he perceived it was cloth of gold, richly embossed
with pearls and diamonds; and that there was
laid by the bed a habit of the same stuff and trimmings,
with a caliph&rsquo;s turban.</p>
<p>At the sight of these glittering objects, Abon Hassan
was in the most inexpressible confusion and
amazement, and looked upon all he saw as a dream.
So, said he to himself, I am caliph; but, added he a
little after, it is only a dream, the effect of the wish I
entertained my guest with last night; and then he
turned himself about to sleep again. At the same
time, the eunuch said very respectfully, Commander
of the Faithful, it is time for your majesty to rise to
prayers; the morning begins to advance.</p>
<p>These words very much surprised Abon Hassan.
Am I awake, or do I sleep? said he to himself. Ah!
certainly I am asleep! continued he, keeping his eyes
shut; there is no reason to doubt of it.</p>
<p>Immediately the eunuch, who saw he had no inclination
to get up, and that he gave him no answer,
said again, Your majesty, I hope, will not be angry, if
<span class="pb" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
I tell you once more that it is time to rise to morning
prayer, which you never neglect, and the sun is
just upon rising. I am mistaken, said Abon Hassan
presently; I am not asleep, but awake: for those
that sleep do not hear, and I hear very distinctly.
Then opening his eyes, he saw plainly by broad daylight,
what appeared but uncertain before, and rising
upon his breech, with a smiling countenance, like a
man overjoyed at a sudden promotion, pleased the
caliph, who penetrated into the bottom of his thoughts.</p>
<p>Then the ladies of the palace prostrated themselves
with their faces to the ground before Abon Hassan,
and those who had the instruments of music in their
hands, wished him a good-morrow, by a concert of
soft flutes, hautboys, theorboes, and other harmonious
instruments, with which he was ravished, and
was in such an ecstasy, that he knew not himself, nor
where he was; but, recovering at last his first idea,
he doubted whether what he saw was a dream or
matter of fact. He clapped his hands before his eyes,
and lowering his head, said to himself, What means
all this? where am I? and whom does this palace belong
to? What can these eunuchs, officers, beautiful
ladies, and musicians signify? How is it possible for
me to distinguish whether I am in my right senses or
in a dream? When he took his hands from his eyes,
the sun shone full in at the chamber-window; and at
that instant, Mesrour, the chief of the eunuchs, came
in, prostrated himself before Abon Hassan, and said,
Commander of the Faithful, your majesty will excuse
me for representing to you, that you used not to lie
so long, and that the time of prayer is over; I am
afraid your majesty has had an ill night, and has
been indisposed, and may not be able to ascend your
throne in council as usual: all your generals, governors,
and other officers of state, wait your presence in
the council-hall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">[284]</div>
<p>At this discourse of Mesrour&rsquo;s, Abon Hassan was
verily persuaded that he was neither asleep nor in a
dream; but, at the same time, was very much embarrassed
and confused. At last, looking earnestly at
Mesrour, he said to him in a serious tone, Who is it
you speak to, and call the commander of the faithful?
For my part, I do not know you, and you mistake
me for somebody else.</p>
<p>Any person but Mesrour would have been dashed
at these questions of Abon Hassan&rsquo;s; but he had
been so well instructed by the caliph, that he played
his part to a wonder. My worthy lord and master, said
he, your majesty only speaks thus to try me: is not
your majesty the commander of the faithful, monarch
of the world, and the prophet&rsquo;s vicar on earth? Mesrour,
your slave, has not forgot you, after so many
years that he has had the honour and happiness to
serve and pay his respects to your majesty; and
should think himself the most unhappy of all men if
he has incurred your displeasure, and begs of you most
humbly to remove his fears; but is apt to believe that
you have been disturbed by some troublesome dream
last night.</p>
<p>Abon Hassan burst out a-laughing at these words
of Mesrour&rsquo;s, and fell backwards upon the bolster,
which pleased the caliph so much, that he would have
laughed as loud himself, if he had not been afraid
of putting a stop to the pleasant scene he promised
himself.</p>
<p>Abon Hassan, when he had tired himself with
laughing, sat up again on his breech, and, speaking
to a little black eunuch that stood by him, said, Hark
ye, tell me who I am. Sir, answered the little boy
modestly, your majesty is the commander of the believers,
and God&rsquo;s vicar on earth. You are a liar,
sooty face, said Abon Hassan. Then he called the
lady that stood the nearest to him: Come hither, fair
<span class="pb" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
one, said he, holding out his hand, bite the end of
my finger, that I may feel whether I am asleep or
awake.</p>
<p>The lady, who knew the caliph saw all that passed,
was overjoyed to show how capable she was of diverting
him, and went with a grave countenance, and
putting his finger between her teeth, she bit so hard
that he cried out; and, snatching his hand quickly
back again, said, I find I am awake, and not asleep.
But by what miracle am I become caliph in a night&rsquo;s
time? This is certainly the most strange and surprising
thing in the world! Then addressing himself
to the same lady, he said, I conjure you, for Heaven&rsquo;s
sake, not to hide the truth from me; am I
really the commander of the faithful? It is so true,
answered the lady, that we, who are your slaves, are
amazed to find that you will not believe yourself to be
so. Ah! you are a deceiver, replied Abon Hassan;
I know very well who I am.</p>
<p>As the chief of the eunuchs perceived that Abon
Hassan had a mind to rise, he lent him his hand,
and helped him to get out of bed. No sooner
were his feet set on the floor, than the chamber rang
again with repeated acclamations of the officers and
ladies, who cried out, God preserve your majesty,
and give you a good day. O Heaven! cried Abon
Hassan, what a strange thing is this! Last night I
was Abon Hassan, and this morning I am the commander
of the believers! I cannot comprehend this
sudden and surprising change. Presently some of
the officers began to dress him; and when they had
done, Mesrour led him through all the eunuchs and
ladies, who were ranged on both sides quite to the
council-chamber door, which was opened by one of
the huissirs. Mesrour walked before him to the foot
of the throne, where he stopped, and putting one
hand under one arm, while another officer did the
<span class="pb" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
same by the other, they helped him to ascend the
throne.</p>
<p>The caliph, in the mean time, came out of the closet
where he was hid, and went into another which
looked into the council-hall, from whence he could
hear all that passed, and see Abon Hassan, who filled
his throne with all the gravity imaginable.</p>
<p>As soon as Abon Hassan had seated himself, the
grand vizier Giafar prostrated himself at the foot of
the throne, and addressing himself to him, said, God
shower down blessings on your majesty in this life,
receive you into his paradise in the other world, and
confound your enemies!</p>
<p>Abon Hassan, after all that had happened that
morning, and these words of the grand vizier, never
doubted but he was caliph, as he wished to be; and
so, without examining any farther, how, or by what
adventure or sudden change of fortune, he immediately
began to exercise his power, and looking very
gravely upon the vizier, asked him what he had to
say. Commander of the Faithful, replied the grand
vizier, the emirs, viziers, and other officers who are
of your majesty&rsquo;s council, wait at the door, until your
majesty give them leave to come in, and pay their
usual respects to you. Abon Hassan presently bade
that the door be opened, and the grand vizier gave
the sign to the huissir that waited for it.</p>
<p>When the door was opened, the viziers, emirs, and
principal officers of the court, all dressed magnificently
in their habits of ceremony, went in their order
to the foot of the throne, and paid their respects
to Abon Hassan; and bowing their heads down to
the carpet, kneeling on one knee, saluted him with
the title of Commander of the Faithful, according to
the instruction of the grand vizier, and afterwards
took their seats.</p>
<p>When this ceremony was over, the grand vizier,
<span class="pb" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
standing before the throne, began with papers in his
hand to make his report of affairs, which at that
time were of very little consequence. Nevertheless,
Abon Hassan acquitted himself in his great post
without the least embarrassment; and gave judgment
so well in all matters, that the caliph could not
help wondering at his address. But before the grand
vizier had finished his report, Abon Hassan called
the judge of the police, whom he knew by sight, as
he sat in his place: Hold, said he to the grand
vizier, I have something to order the judge of the
police. The judge of the police perceiving that
Abon Hassan looked at him, and hearing his name
mentioned, arose from his seat, and went gravely to
the foot of the throne, where he prostrated himself
with his face to the ground. Judge of the police,
said Abon Hassan, go immediately to such a division,
and seize the iman of the mosque, and four old
men, (whom he described,) and give each of the old
men a hundred bastinadoes with a bull&rsquo;s pizzle, and
the iman four hundred: after that, mount them all
five on camels, with their faces to the tails; and lead
them through the whole city, with a crier before
them, who shall proclaim, This is the punishment of
all those who trouble their heads with other people&rsquo;s
affairs, and make it their business to create disturbances
and misunderstandings in families in their
neighbourhood. My intention is also, that you enjoin
them to leave that division, and never to set a
foot more in it; and while your lieutenant is conducting
them through the town, return, and give me
an account of the execution of my orders. The judge
of the police laid his hand upon his head, to show his
obedience, and, prostrating himself a second time,
went away.</p>
<p>The caliph was extremely well pleased at this order;
and perceived by Abon Hassan&rsquo;s strictness and
<span class="pb" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
expedition, that he was resolved not to lose the opportunity
of punishing the iman and the other four
old hypocrites. In the mean time, the grand vizier
went on with his report, and had just done when the
judge of the police came back from executing his
commission. He went to the throne with the usual
ceremony, and said, Commander of the Faithful, I
found the iman and his four companions; and for a
proof that I have punctually obeyed your commands,
I have brought an instrument signed by the principal
inhabitants of that division: at the same time, he
pulled out a paper, and presented it to the pretended
caliph.</p>
<p>Abon Hassan took the paper, and reading over the
names of the witnesses, who were all people that he
knew very well, said to the judge of the police, It is
very well; return to your seat. These old hypocrites,
said he to himself, with a great deal of satisfaction
in his looks, who must be censuring my
actions, and finding fault with my entertaining honest
people, deserved this punishment. The caliph
all the time penetrated into his thoughts, and conceived
a sensible joy in this expedition.</p>
<p>Then Abon Hassan, addressing himself afterwards
to the grand vizier, said, Go to the high treasurer
for a purse of a thousand pieces of gold, and carry it
to the mother of Abon Hassan, who is known by the
name of the Debauchee; she lives in the same division
into which I sent the judge of the police: return
immediately.</p>
<p>The grand vizier, after laying his hand upon his
head, and prostrating himself before the throne,
went to the high treasurer, who gave him the money,
which he ordered a slave to take, and follow him to
Abon Hassan&rsquo;s mother, to whom he gave it, saying
only, The caliph makes you this present. She received
it with the greatest surprise imaginable, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
could not tell what to think of this liberality of the
caliph.</p>
<p>During the grand vizier&rsquo;s absence, the judge of the
police acted for him, in making the report, which
lasted till the vizier returned. As soon as he came
into the council-chamber, and had assured Abon
Hassan he had done as he had bade him, Mesrour,
the chief of the eunuchs, who returned to the palace
after he had conducted Abon Hassan to the council,
came again, and made a sign to the viziers, emirs,
and other officers, that the council was done, and
that they might all retire; which they all did, by
making the same reverence and obedience as when
they entered.</p>
<p>Abon Hassan sat not long after them, but came
down from the throne, supported in the same manner
as he went up to it, by Mesrour and another eunuch,
who attended him back again to the apartment from
whence he came, preceded all the way by the grand
vizier: but before he reached the apartment, he was
taken with a pressing occasion; upon which they
showed him into a convenient closet, paved with
white marble; and while Abon Hassan was there,
the grand vizier went to acquaint the caliph with
what had passed, though he had been an eye-witness
all the time.</p>
<p>When Abon Hassan came out of the closet, Mesrour
went before him, to show him the way into an
inner apartment, where there was a table spread.
Several eunuchs ran before, to tell the musicians that
the sham caliph was coming, who immediately began
a concert of vocal and instrumental music, with
which Abon Hassan was so charmed and transported,
that he could not tell what to think at all he saw and
heard. If this is a dream, said he, it is a long one:
but certainly, continued he, it is no dream; for I can
see and feel, walk, hear, and argue reasonably.
<span class="pb" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
Whatever it is, I trust in God: yet I cannot believe
but I am the commander of the faithful; for no
other person could live in this splendour. The honour
and respect that is given me, and the obedience
paid to my commands, are sufficient proofs.</p>
<p>In short, Abon Hassan took it for granted that he
was caliph, and the commander of the faithful; and
was fully convinced of it, when he entered that magnificent
and spacious hall, which was finely painted.
Seven bands of musicians were placed round the hall,
and as many gold branches hung down from the ceiling,
which was painted with blue and gold. In the
middle of the hall there was spread a table, which
was served up with all manner of rarities, in massy
gold plates and dishes; and seven young beautiful
ladies, dressed in the richest habits, of the most
lively colours, stood round this table, each with a
fan in her hand, to fan Abon Hassan when at dinner.</p>
<p>If ever mortal was charmed, Abon Hassan was:
at every step he took in that stately hall, he could
not help stopping to contemplate on all the wonders
that regaled his eyes, and turned his head first on
one side and then again on the other, which made
the caliph almost split his sides with laughing. At
last he went and sat down at the table, and presently
all the ladies that stood about it began to fan him.
He looked first at one and then at another, and admired
the grace with which they acquitted themselves;
and told them, with a smile, that he believed
one fan was enough to cool him, and would have six
of the ladies sit at table with him, three on his right
hand and three on his left; that, as the table was
round, which way soever he turned, his eyes might
be saluted with agreeable objects.</p>
<p>The six ladies obeyed; and Abon Hassan taking
notice that, out of respect, they did not eat, helped
them himself, and invited them to eat in the most
<span class="pb" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
pressing and obliging terms. Afterwards, he asked
their names; which they told him were, White neck,
Coral Lips, Fair Face, Sun Shine, Heart&rsquo;s Delight,
Sweet Looks, and she who fanned him was Sugar
Cane. The many soft things he said upon their
names, showed him to be a man of a sprightly wit,
and very much increased the esteem which the caliph
(who saw every thing) had for him.</p>
<p>When the ladies saw that Abon Hassan had done
eating, one of them said to the eunuch who waited,
the commander of the faithful will go into the next
hall to the desert: bring some water. Upon which
they all rose from the table, and taking from the eunuchs,
one a gold basin, another an ewer, and a third a
towel, kneeled down before Abon Hassan, and presented
them to him to wash his hands; who, as soon
as he had done, got up, and after an eunuch had opened
the door, went, preceded by Mesrour, who never left
him, into another hall, as large as the former, adorned
with the best paintings, gold vessels, silk tapestry,
and other rich furniture. There seven other
bands of music began a new concert, as soon as
Abon Hassan appeared. In this hall there were
seven gold branches, and a table full of dried sweetmeats,
and the most choice and exquisite fruits, raised
in pyramids, in seven gold basins, and seven ladies,
more beautiful than the others, standing round it,
with fans in their hands.</p>
<p>These new objects put Abon Hassan into a greater
admiration than ever; who, after he had made a full
stop, and given the most sensible marks of his surprise
and astonishment, went directly to the table;
where, sitting down, he gazed a considerable time
at the seven ladies, with an embarrassment that
plainly showed he knew not which to give the preference
to. At last he ordered them all to sit and
<span class="pb" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
eat with him, telling them that it was not so hot but
he could spare them that trouble.</p>
<p>When the ladies were all placed about him, the
first thing he did was to ask their names, which were
different from the other seven, and expressed some
perfection of either mind or body, which distinguished
them from one another; and upon which he took
an opportunity, when he presented them with fruit,
&amp;c. to say somewhat that was handsome. Take this
fig, said he to Chain of Hearts, who sat on his right
hand, and render the fetters with which you loaded
me at first sight more supportable; and so went on
to the rest. By these ways, Abon Hassan pleased
and diverted the caliph more and more, who was resolved
to carry on this scene which entertained him
so agreeably.</p>
<p>After Abon Hassan had tasted of all the fruits, &amp;c.
he got up and followed Mesrour into a third hall,
much more magnificently furnished than the other
two; where he was received by the same number of
musicians and ladies, who stood about a table covered
over with all manner of sweetmeats. After he had
looked about him with new admiration, he advanced
to the table, the music playing all the time, which
ceased when he sat down. The seven ladies sat
down with him, by his order, and helped themselves,
as he desired them, to what they liked best; and afterwards
he informed himself of their names, which
pleased him as much as the others had done.</p>
<p>By this time the day began to close, and Abon
Hassan was conducted into the fourth hall, much
more stately and magnificently furnished, lighted with
wax-candles, in seven gold branches and sconces,
which were placed all around it, all which made a
glorious light. Abon Hassan found the same number
of musicians here as he had done in the other halls,
<span class="pb" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
and saw also as many ladies standing round a table,
furnished with such things as were proper to promote
drinking. There he saw a beaufet, which he
had not observed in any of the other halls, which
was set out with seven large silver flagons full of
the choicest wines, and seven crystal glasses by
them.</p>
<p>All the day long, Abon Hassan had drunk nothing
but water, according to a custom observed at Bagdad,
from the highest to the lowest; who never drink
wine till the evening, it being accounted the most
scandalous thing in the world to be seen drunk in the
streets in the day-time.</p>
<p>As soon as Abon Hassan entered the fourth hall,
he went directly to the table and sat down, and was
a long time in a kind of ecstasy at the sight of those
seven ladies, who were much more beautiful than all
he beheld in the other halls. He was very desirous
to know all their names; but the music playing then
so very loud that he could not hear them speak, he
made a sign for them to leave off playing: then taking
one of the ladies who sat next to him by the hand,
he made her sit down by him, and presenting her
with some of those relishing viands before him, asked
her name. Commander of the Faithful, said the
lady, I am called Cluster of Pearls. No name, replied
Abon Hassan, could have more properly expressed
your worth; and indeed your teeth exceed
the finest pearls. Cluster of Pearls, added he, since
that is your name, oblige me with a glass of wine from
your fair hand. The lady went presently to the
beaufet, and brought him a glass with a pleasant air.
Abon Hassan took the glass with a smile, and looking
passionately upon her; said, Cluster of Pearls,
your health; I desire you to fill out as much for yourself,
and pledge me. Accordingly she went to the
beaufet, and returned with a glass in her hand; but
<span class="pb" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
before she drank, she sang a song, and by the sweetness
of her voice ravished his senses.</p>
<p>After Abon Hassan had drunk, he made another
lady sit, and presenting her with some of the viands,
asked her name, which she told him was Morning
Star. Your bright eyes, said he, shine with greater
lustre than that star you bear the name of. Do me
the pleasure to bring me some wine; which she did,
with an extraordinary grace. Then turning to the
third lady, whose name was Daylight, he ordered her
to do the same; and so on to the seventh, to the extreme
satisfaction of the caliph.</p>
<p>When they had all filled him round, Cluster of
Pearls went to the beaufet, poured out a glass of
wine, and putting in a pinch of the same powder the
caliph had used the night before, presented it to
Abon Hassan. Commander of the Faithful, said she,
I beg of your majesty to take this glass of wine; and,
before you drink it off, do me the favour to hear a
song I have made to-day, and which may not displease
you. With all my heart, said Abon Hassan,
taking the glass; and, as commander of the faithful,
I command you to sing it: for I am persuaded
that so beautiful a lady as yourself must abound with
wit and humour. The lady took a lute, and tuning
it to her voice, sang with so much justness and grace,
and with such delicate turns of thought and expression,
that Abon Hassan was in perfect ecstasy all the
time, and was so much delighted, that he ordered her
to sing it again.</p>
<p>When the lady had done, Abon Hassan drank off
his glass, and, turning his head towards her, to give
her those praises which he thought due to her, fell
fast asleep with his mouth open gaping, and his
eyes close shut, just in the same condition as when
the caliph brought him from home; who took a
greater satisfaction in this scene, than he could have
<span class="pb" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
promised himself. One of the ladies stood ready to
catch the glass, which fell out of his hand; and then
the caliph, who was all along a spectator of what
had passed, came into the hall to them, and ordered
Abon Hassan to be dressed again in his own clothes,
and to be carried back again to his own house by the
same slave that brought him, charging him to lay
him on a sofa in the same room, and to leave the
door open.</p>
<p>The slave took Abon Hassan upon his shoulders,
and carried him home by a back-door of the palace,
and returned with speed to acquaint the caliph he
had executed his commands. Well, said the caliph,
Abon Hassan wished only to be caliph for one day,
to punish the iman of the mosque, and the four
scheiks or old men of his division, who had displeased
him: I have procured him the means, and
he ought to be content.</p>
<p>In the mean time, Abon Hassan, who was laid
upon a sofa by the slave, slept very late the next
morning. When the powder was worked off, Abon
Hassan opened his eyes, and finding himself at
home, was in the utmost surprise. Cluster of Pearls!
Morning Star! Coral Lips! Fair Face! cried he,
calling the ladies of the palace by their names, as he
remembered them: Where are you? Come hither.</p>
<p>Abon Hassan called so loud, that his mother, who
was in her own apartment, heard, and running to
him upon the noise he made, said, What do you
mean, son? What is the matter? At these words,
Abon Hassan lifted up his head, and looking haughtily
at his mother, said, Good woman, who is it you
call son? Why, you, answered his mother, very
calmly; are not you Abon Hassan, my son? It is
a strange thing that you have forgot yourself. I
your son, old trull! replied Abon Hassan; thou art
mad, and knowest not what thou sayest: I am not
<span class="pb" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
Abon Hassan, I tell you, but the commander of the
faithful.</p>
<p>Hold your tongue, son, answered the mother; one
would think you were a fool, to hear you talk thus.
You are an old fool yourself, replied Abon Hassan:
I tell you once more, I am the commander of the
faithful, and God&rsquo;s vicar on earth. Ah! child, cried
the mother, is it possible that I should hear you utter
such words, that show you are distracted? What
evil genius possesses you, to make you talk at this
rate? God bless you, and preserve you from the
power of Satan. You are my son Abon Hassan, and
I am your mother.</p>
<p>After she had made use of all the arguments she
could think of to bring him to himself, and to show
how great an error he was in, she said, Do not you
see that the room you are now in is your own, and is
not like a chamber fit for the commander of the
believers? Think seriously of what I have said to
you, and do not fancy things that are not, nor ever
can be.</p>
<p>Abon Hassan heard all these remonstrances of his
mother very patiently, holding down his eyes, and
clapping his hands before his face, like one who was
looking into himself to examine the truth of what he
saw and heard. At last, said he to his mother, just
as if he was come out of a deep sleep, and with his
hands in the same posture, Methinks I am Abon
Hassan, you are my mother, and I am in my own
room. Then looking about him again, he added, I
am Abon Hassan, there is no doubt of it; and I cannot
comprehend how this fancy came into my head.</p>
<p>The mother really believed that her son was cured
of that disorder of mind, and began to laugh, and
ask him questions about his dream; when, all on a
sudden, he started up on his breech, and looking
crossly at his mother, said, Old sorceress, thou
<span class="pb" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
knowest not what thou sayest. I am not thy son,
nor thou my mother, but the commander of the
faithful; and thou shalt never persuade me to the
contrary. For heaven&rsquo;s sake, son, said the mother,
let us leave off this discourse, and talk of something
else, for fear some misfortune should happen to us. I
will tell you what fell out yesterday in our division
to the iman of the mosque, and the four scheiks our
neighbours: the judge of the police came and seized
them, and gave each of them I do not know how
many strokes with a bull&rsquo;s pizzle; and afterwards led
them through all the streets, with a crier before
them, who proclaimed, that that was the punishment
of all those who troubled themselves about other
folks&rsquo; business, and set their neighbours at variance;
and ordered them never to come into our division
again. Abon Hassan&rsquo;s mother could not imagine
that her son had any share in this adventure, and
therefore turned the discourse this way to put him
out of the conceit of being the commander of the
faithful; but instead of effacing that idea, she rather
strengthened it.</p>
<p>Abon Hassan no sooner heard this relation, than he
cried out, I am neither thy son, nor Abon Hassan,
but certainly the commander of the believers: I cannot
doubt of it, after what you have told me. Know
then, that it was by my order that the iman and the
four scheiks were punished; and I tell you, I am
certainly the commander of the faithful; therefore
do not tell me any more of its being a dream. I was
not asleep, but as much awake as I am now. You do
me a pleasure to confirm what the judge of the police
told me he had executed according to my order; and
I am overjoyed that the iman and the four scheiks,
those great hypocrites, were so chastised, and would
be glad to know how I came here. God be praised
for all things! I am certainly commander of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
faithful, and all thy arguments shall not convince me
to the contrary.</p>
<p>The mother, who could not divine or imagine why
her son supported and maintained himself so strenuously
to be caliph, never disputed but that he had
lost his senses, when she found he insisted so much
upon a thing that was so incredible; and in this
thought said, I pray God to have mercy upon you,
son! pray do not talk so madly. Beseech God to
forgive you, and give you grace to talk more reasonably.
What would the world say to hear you rave
in this manner? Do not you know, they say walls
have ears?</p>
<p>These remonstrances only enraged Abon Hassan
the more; and he was so provoked at his mother,
that he said, Old woman, I have bid you once already
hold your tongue; if you do not, I shall rise
and give you cause to repent it all your life-time. I
am the caliph, and the commander of the believers;
and you ought to believe me when I say so.</p>
<p>Then the good woman perceiving that he was
more lunatic than ever, abandoned herself to tears;
and beating her face and breast, expressed the utmost
grief and astonishment to see her son in that distraction.
Abon Hassan, instead of appeasing and
being moved by his mother&rsquo;s tears, on the contrary,
lost all the respect due from a son to his mother;
and getting up hastily, and laying hold of a cane, ran
to his mother in great fury, and in a threatening
manner said, Tell me presently, wicked woman, who
I am. I do not believe, son, replied she, looking at
him tenderly, and void of fear, that you are so abandoned
by God as not to know your mother, who
brought you into the world. Indeed you are my son
Abon Hassan; and are very much in the wrong to
arrogate to yourself the title of our sovereign lord the
caliph Haroun Alraschid, after the noble and generous
<span class="pb" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
present that monarch made us yesterday. In
short, I forgot to tell you, that the grand vizier Giafar
came to me yesterday, and putting a purse of a
thousand pieces of gold into my hands, bade me pray
for the commander of the faithful, who made me that
present.</p>
<p>At these words, Abon Hassan grew quite mad.
The circumstance of the caliph&rsquo;s liberality his mother
told him of, persuaded him more than ever that he
was caliph, remembering how he had sent the vizier.
Well, old hag, cried he, will you be convinced when
I tell you that I sent you those thousand pieces of
gold by my grand vizier Giafar, who obeyed my
commands, as I was commander of the faithful? But,
instead of believing me, thou endeavourest to distract
me by thy contradictions, and maintainest with obstinacy
that I am thy son; but thou shalt not go long
unpunished. After these words, he was so unnatural,
in the height of his frenzy, as to beat her cruelly with
his cane.</p>
<p>The poor mother, who could not have thought that
her son would have come so soon from words to
blows, called out for help so loud, that the neighbours
ran in to her assistance. But in the mean
time, Abon Hassan, at every stroke, asked her if
he was the commander of the faithful. To which she
always answered tenderly, that he was her son.</p>
<p>By the time the neighbours came in, Abon Hassan&rsquo;s
rage began to abate. The first who entered
the room got between him and his mother; and taking
the cane out of his hand, said to him, What are
you doing, Abon Hassan? Have you no fear of God,
nor reason? Did ever a son, so well brought up as
you, ever dare to strike his mother? Are you not
ashamed to treat yours so, who loves you so tenderly?
Abon Hassan looked at him that spoke, without
returning an answer; and then staring on all
<span class="pb" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
that followed him, said, Who is that Abon Hassan
you speak of? Is it me you call by that name?</p>
<p>This question put the neighbours a little to a stand.
How! said he that spoke first, do not you know your
mother, who brought you up, and with whom you
have always lived? Be gone, you are impertinent
people, replied Abon Hassan; I neither know her
nor you, and will not know you; I am not Abon Hassan;
but will make you know, to your cost, I am the
commander of the faithful.</p>
<p>At this discourse, the neighbours no longer doubted
but that he was mad; and to prevent his being guilty
of the like actions, seized him, notwithstanding his
resistance, and bound him hand and foot, while one
in the mean time ran for the keeper of the hospital for
mad folks, who came presently with a bull&rsquo;s pizzle,
chains, and handcuffs, and a great many attendants.
When they entered the room, Abon Hassan, who little
expected such treatment, endeavoured all he could to
unloose himself; but after the keeper had given him
two or three smart strokes upon his shoulders with
the bull&rsquo;s pizzle, he lay so quiet, that the keeper and
his people might do what they would with him; who
as soon as they had bound and manacled him, took
him with them to the hospital; where, before the
keeper put him into a room, he regaled him with fifty
strokes of the bull&rsquo;s pizzle on his shoulders, which he
repeated every day without pity for three weeks,
bidding him to remember that he was not the commander
of the faithful.</p>
<p>Abon Hassan&rsquo;s mother went every day to see her
son, and could not forbear crying to see him fall away
daily, and to hear him sigh and complain at the hardships
he endured. In short, his shoulders, back, and
sides were so black and blue and bruized, that he
could not turn himself. His mother would willingly
have talked with him, to comfort him, and to sound
<span class="pb" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
him whether he still retained the notion of being caliph;
but whenever she opened her mouth, he rebuked
her with so much fury, that she was forced to leave
him, and return home disconsolate at his obstinacy.</p>
<p>At last those strong and lively ideas which Abon
Hassan entertained of being clothed in the caliph&rsquo;s
habit, and having used all his authority, and being
obeyed very punctually, and treated like the true caliph,
and which persuaded him when he waked that
he was so, all began to be insensibly effaced. Sometimes
he would say to himself, If I was the caliph,
and commander of the believers, how came I home
dressed in my own apparel? Why should I not have
been attended by eunuchs and ladies? Why should
my grand Vizier Giafar, and all those emirs and
governors of provinces, who prostrated themselves at
my feet, forsake me? Undoubtedly if I had any
authority over them, they would have delivered me all
this time out of this miserable condition I am in: certainly
I ought to look upon all this as a dream. It is
true, I commanded the judge of the police to punish
the iman and four old men his companions: I ordered
Giafar the grand vizier to carry my mother a thousand
pieces of gold: and all my commands were executed.
All these things are obstacles to my believing it a
dream; but yet there are so many things that I cannot
comprehend, nor ever shall, that I will put my trust
in God, who knows all things.</p>
<p>Abon Hassan was taken up with these thoughts
and sentiments, when his mother came to see him,
who found him so much altered and changed from
what he had been, that she let fall a torrent of tears;
in the midst of which she saluted him as she used to
do, and he returned her salute, which he had never
done before while he had been in the hospital. This
civility she looked upon to be a good sign. Well, son,
said she, how do you do, and how do you find yourself?
<span class="pb" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
Have you renounced all those whims and fancies
which some cursed demon had put into your head?
Indeed, mother, replied Abon Hassan, very rationally
and calmly, I acknowledge my error, and beg of you
to forgive the execrable crime which I have been
guilty of towards you, and which I detest. I ask pardon
also of my neighbours whom I have abused. I
have been deceived by a dream; but by so extraordinary
a one, and so like to truth, that any other person,
to whom such a thing might have happened, would
have been guilty of as great extravagances: and I am
at this instant so much perplexed about it, that I can
hardly persuade myself but that it was matter of
fact. But whatever it was, I do and always will look
upon it as a dream and illusion. I am convinced that
I am not that shadow of a caliph and commander of
the faithful, but Abon Hassan, your son; and shall
never forget that fatal day which covered me with
shame and confusion; but honour and respect you all
my life as I ought.</p>
<p>At these sensible words, the mother of Abon Hassan
changed the tears of her sorrow and affliction into
those of joy, to find her son so well recovered. My
dear child, said she, transported with pleasure, my
satisfaction and comfort is inexpressible, to hear you
talk so reasonably, and gives me as much joy as if I
had brought you into the world a second time. But
I must observe one thing in this adventure, which you
may not have taken notice of: the stranger that you
brought home one night to sup with you, went away
without shutting the chamber-door after him as you
desired him; which I believe gave some demon an
opportunity to enter, and put you into that horrible
illusion you were in: and therefore, my son, you ought
to return God thanks for your deliverance, and beseech
him to keep you out of the snares of the evil
spirit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_303">[303]</div>
<p>You have found out the source of my misfortunes,
answered Abon Hassan; it was that very night I had
this dream, which turned my brain. I bade the merchant
expressly to shut the door after him; and now
I find he did not do it. I am persuaded, as well as
you, some devil came in, and filled my head full of
these fancies. For they at Moussel are not so well
convinced that the devil is the cause of troublesome
dreams, as we are at Bagdad. But since, mother,
you see I am so well recovered, for God&rsquo;s sake get me
out of this hellish place. The mother, glad to find
her son so well cured of his foolish imagination of
being caliph, went immediately to the keeper, and
assuring him that he was very sensible and well, he
came and examined him, and afterwards gave him his
liberty.</p>
<p>When Abon Hassan came home, he staid within
doors some days, to comfort himself by better food and
nourishment than what he had at the hospital. But
when he had recovered his strength, and refreshed
himself after his harsh treatment, he began to be
weary with spending his evenings alone, and so entered
again upon the same way of living as before;
which was to provide enough every day to regale a
stranger at night.</p>
<p>The day on which Abon Hassan renewed this custom,
happened to be the first day of the month, which
was the day that the caliph always sets apart to go
disguised through the town, to observe what irregularities
were committed in the government of the city.
Towards the evening he went to the bridge, and set
himself on a bench which was fixed to the parapet;
where, looking about him, he perceived the caliph
disguised again like a Moussel merchant, and followed
by the same slave: and, persuaded that all his
misfortunes were owing to the caliph&rsquo;s leaving his
door open, whom he took for a merchant, he swooned
<span class="pb" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
at the sight of him. God preserve me, said he to
himself; if I am not deceived, there is the magician
again that enchanted me! and thereupon got up, and
looked over the parapet into the river, that he might
not see him.</p>
<p>The caliph, who had a mind to carry on his joke
farther, had taken a great deal of care to inform himself
of all that had happened when Abon Hassan
waked at home, and conceived a great pleasure at the
relation given him, especially at his being sent to a
mad-house. But that monarch was both just and generous,
and had taken a great liking to Abon Hassan:
he designed, after he had carried on this scene, to take
him into his palace; and to pursue this project, he
had dressed himself again like a merchant of Moussel.
He perceived Abon Hassan at the same time that he
saw him, and presently guessed by his actions that he
was angry with him, and wanted to shun him. This
made him walk close to the parapet Abon Hassan
leaned over; and when he came nigh him, he put his
head over to look him in the face. Ah, brother Abon
Hassan, said he, is it you? give me leave to embrace
you. Not I, replied Abon Hassan roughly, without
looking at the pretended Moussel merchant: I will
not embrace you; I have nothing to say to you; go
along.</p>
<p>What! answered the caliph, do you not know me?
Do you not remember the evening we spent together
at your house this day month, where you did me the
honour to treat me very generously? No, replied
Abon Hassan, I do not know you, nor what you talk
about: go, I say again, about your business.</p>
<p>The caliph was not to be dashed with this rude
behaviour of Abon Hassan. He knew very well the
law he had imposed on himself, never to have any
commerce again with a stranger he had once entertained;
but though Abon Hassan had declared so
<span class="pb" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
much to him, he pretended to be ignorant of it. I
cannot believe, said he, but you must know me again;
it is not possible that you should have forgot me in
so short a time. Certainly some misfortune has befallen
you, which gives you this aversion. However,
you ought to remember that I show my acknowledgment
by my good wishes; and that I have offered you
my interest, which is not despicable, in an affair which
you had very much at heart.</p>
<p>I do not know, replied Abon Hassan, what your
interest may be, and I have no desire to make use of
it; but I am sensible the utmost of your wishes was
to make me mad. In God&rsquo;s name, I say once more,
go your way, and trouble me no more.</p>
<p>Ah! brother Abon Hassan, replied the caliph, embracing
him, I do not intend to part with you in this
manner, since I have had the good fortune to meet
with you a second time: you must exercise the same
hospitality towards me again that you showed me
a month ago, when I had the honour to drink with
you.</p>
<p>I have protested against it, said Abon Hassan, and
have so much power over myself as not to receive such
a man as you. You know the proverb, Take up your
drum and be gone: make the application to yourself.
God be with you; you have been the cause of my
misfortune, and I will not venture myself with you
again. My good friend Abon Hassan, said the caliph,
embracing him again, I beg of you not to treat me
after this injurious manner, but be better persuaded
of my friendship. Do me the favour to tell me what
has happened to you; for I assure you, I wish you
well, and would be glad of an opportunity to make you
amends for the trouble I have caused you, if it has
been actually my fault. Abon Hassan yielded to the
pressing instances of the caliph, and bade him sit down
by him. Your incredulity and importunity have tired
<span class="pb" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
my patience; and what I am going to tell you, will
show you that I do not accuse you wrongfully.</p>
<p>The caliph sat down by Abon Hassan, while he
told him all that happened to him, from his waking
in the palace to his waking again in his own house,
all as a mere dream, with all the circumstances, which
the caliph knew as well as himself, and which renewed
his pleasure. He exaggerated afterwards upon the
impression that dream of being caliph made upon him,
which, he said, threw him into such extravagances,
that he was carried to the mad-house, and used very
barbarously. But, said he, what will surprise you,
and what you little think of, is, that it was altogether
your fault that these things fell out: for, if you remember,
I desired you to shut the door after you,
which you neglected; and some devil finding it open,
put this dream into my head, which, though it was
very agreeable, was the cause of the misfortune I complain
of; therefore you, for your negligence, are answerable
for the horrid and detestable crime I was
guilty of, in lifting my hand against my mother, whom
I might have killed, and committed parricide, because
she said I was her son, and she would not acknowledge
me for the commander of the faithful: besides,
I blush when I think of it, and that all my neighbours
were witnesses of my folly. In short, Abon Hassan
complained of his misfortunes with great heat and
vehemence, and did not forget the least circumstance;
which pleased the caliph to find he had succeeded so
well, who could not help bursting out a-laughing at
the simplicity wherewith he related them.</p>
<p>Abon Hassan, who thought that his story should
rather move compassion, and that every one ought to
be as much concerned at it as himself, very much resented
the pretended Moussel merchant&rsquo;s laughter.
What! said he, do you make a jest of me, to laugh in
my face, or do you believe that I do not speak seriously?
<span class="pb" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
If you want proofs of what I advance, look
and see whether or no I tell you the truth: with that,
stooping down, and baring his shoulders, he showed
the caliph the strokes and weals the bull&rsquo;s pizzle had
made.</p>
<p>The caliph could not behold these objects of horror
without pitying poor Abon Hassan, and being sorry
for carrying the jest so far. Come, rise, dear brother,
said he, hugging Abon Hassan friendly in his arms;
let me go and enjoy the happiness of being merry with
you to-night; and to-morrow, if it please God, all
things will go well.</p>
<p>Abon Hassan, notwithstanding his resolution and
oath, could not resist the caliph&rsquo;s caresses. I will
consent, said he to the pretended merchant, if you
will swear to shut my door after you, that no demon
may come in to distract my brain again. The caliph
promised that he would; upon which they both got
up, and, followed by the caliph&rsquo;s slave, reached Abon
Hassan&rsquo;s house by the time it was dark.</p>
<p>As soon as Abon Hassan entered the doors, he
called for candles, and desired his guest to sit down
upon a sofa, and then placed himself by him. A little
time after, supper was brought up, and they both fell
to without ceremony: afterwards there came up a
small dessert of fruit, wine, and glasses. Abon Hassan
first filled out his glass, and then the caliph&rsquo;s;
and after they had drunk some time, and talked of
indifferent matters, the caliph perceiving that his host
grew warm with liquor, began to talk of love, and
asked him if he had never been sensible of that passion.</p>
<p>Brother, replied Abon Hassan familiarly, I never
looked upon love or marriage but as bondage or slavery,
to which I was always unwilling to submit; and
must own to you that I never loved any thing but
<span class="pb" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
good cheer and good wine; in short, to divert and
entertain myself agreeably with my friends. But yet
I do not tell you that I am so indifferent for marriage,
or incapable of an inclination, if I could meet with a
woman of such beauty and sweetness of temper as
those I saw in my dream that fatal night I first saw
you, and received you into my house, and you, to my
misfortune, left my door open, who would pass the
whole night with me, drinking, and singing, and playing
on some instrument, and who would study to
please and divert me: I believe, on the contrary, I
should change all my indifference to a perfect attachment
to such a person, and I believe should live very
happily with her. But where is such a woman to be
found, but in the caliph&rsquo;s palace, or in those of the
grand vizier, or some other great lords of the court,
who want no money? I choose rather to stick close to
my bottle, which is a pleasure much cheaper, and
which I can enjoy as well as they. In saying, these
words, he filled out his own and the caliph&rsquo;s glass,
and said, Come, take your glass, and let us pursue this
charming pleasure.</p>
<p>When they had drunk off their wine, It is a great
pity, said the caliph, that so gallant a man as you,
who owns himself not insensible of love, should lead
so solitary a life. I prefer the easy quiet life I live,
replied Abon Hassan, before the company of a wife,
whose beauty might not please, and who, besides,
might create me a great deal of trouble by her imperfections,
and perhaps ill humour. This subject lasted
a long time; and the caliph, seeing Abon Hassan had
drunk up to the pitch he wanted to have him, said,
Let me alone; since you have so good a taste, I warrant
you I will find you one that shall please you:
and then taking Abon Hassan&rsquo;s glass, and putting a
pinch of the same powder into it again, filled him up
<span class="pb" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
a bumper, and presenting it to him, said, Come, let
us drink first the fair lady&rsquo;s health who is to make you
happy.</p>
<p>Abon Hassan took the glass laughing, and shaking
his head, said, Come, I will drink the lady&rsquo;s health you
promised me, though I am very well contented as I
am, and do not rely on your promise; but cannot be
guilty of so great a piece of incivility, as to disoblige
a guest of so much merit, in such a trifling matter.
But as soon as he had drunk off his liquor, he was
seized with as deep a sleep as before; and the caliph
ordered the same slave to take him and carry him to
the palace, and in the mean time shut the door after
him, as he had promised, and followed him.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the palace, the caliph ordered
Abon Hassan to be laid on a sofa, in the fourth
hall, from whence he was carried home: but first he
bade them put him in the same habit which he acted
the caliph in. After that, he charged all the eunuchs;
officers, ladies, and musicians, who were in the hall
when he drank the last glass of wine, to be there by
daybreak, and to take care to act their parts well;
and then went to bed, charging Mesrour to wake him
before they went into the hall, that he might hide himself
in the closet as before.</p>
<p>Mesrour wakened the caliph at the hour appointed;
who immediately rose, and went to the hall where
Abon Hassan was laid fast asleep; and when he had
placed himself in his closet, Mesrour and the other
officers and ladies placed themselves about the sofa,
so that the caliph might see what passed.</p>
<p>Things being thus disposed, and the caliph&rsquo;s powder
having had its effect, Abon Hassan began to stir,
and the music to play a very agreeable concert. Abon
Hassan was in a great surprise to hear that charming
harmony; but when he opened his eyes, and saw the
ladies and officers about him, and which he thought
<span class="pb" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
he knew again, his amazement was redoubled. The
hall that he was in seemed to be the same he dreamed
of; and he observed the same branches, and the same
furniture and ornaments.</p>
<p>When the concert was ended, he bit his finger and
cried loud enough for the caliph to hear him, Alas!
I am fallen again into the same dream and illusion
that happened to me a month ago, and must expect
again the bull&rsquo;s pizzle and mad-house. Almighty
God, added he, I commit myself into the hands of thy
divine providence. He was a wicked man that I entertained
at my house last night, who has been the
cause of this illusion, and the miserable hardships I
must undergo. The base wretch swore to shut the
door after him, and he did not do it; and the devil
came in, and filled my head full of this wicked dream
of being commander of the faithful, and other phantoms,
which bewitch my eyes. May thou be confounded,
Satan, and crushed under some mountain!</p>
<p>After these words, Abon Hassan closed his eyes,
and remained some time thoughtful, and very much
perplexed; then opening them again, and looking
about him, cried out a second time, Great God! I
commit myself into the hands of thy providence; preserve
me from the temptation of Satan. Then shutting
them again, he said, All that I know is, I will
go and sleep till Satan leaves me, and returns as he
came; when one of the ladies approached, and sitting
down on a sofa by him, said to him, Commander of the
Faithful, I beg of your majesty to forgive me for taking
the liberty to tell you not to go to sleep; day appears,
and it is time to rise. Be gone, Satan! answered
Abon Hassan, raising his voice: but looking upon
the lady, he said, Is it I you call the commander of
the faithful? Certainly you take me for somebody
else. It is to your majesty I give that title, replied the
lady, to whom it belongs, as you are sovereign of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
world and the Mussulmans, and I am your most humble
slave. Undoubtedly your majesty, added she,
pretends to have forgot yourself, or this is the effect
of some troublesome dream; but if you would but
open your eyes, the mists which may disturb your
imagination will soon be dispelled, and you will find
yourself in your own palace, surrounded by your officers
and slaves, who all wait your commands: and
that your majesty may not be surprised to find yourself
in this hall, and not in bed, I beg leave to tell
you, that you fell so suddenly asleep last night, that
we were unwilling to wake you, to conduct you to
your own chamber, but laid you carefully upon this
sofa. In short, she urged so many things to him that
were so very probable, that at last he sat upon his
breech, and knew all the ladies again. Then she who
spoke first, assuming the discourse, said, Commander
of the Faithful, and the prophet&rsquo;s vicar on earth, be
not displeased if I acquaint your majesty once more,
that it is time to rise, for day appears.</p>
<p>You are very troublesome and importunate, replied
Abon Hassan, rubbing his eyes: I am not the commander
of the faithful, but Abon Hassan; and you
shall not persuade me otherwise. We do not know
that Abon Hassan your majesty speaks of, answered
the lady; but know you to be the commander of the
believers.</p>
<p>Abon Hassan looking about, and finding himself in
the same hall, attributed all he saw and heard to be
such a dream as he had before, and feared very much
the dreadful consequences. Heaven have mercy on
me! said he, lifting up his hands and eyes, like a man
who knew not where he was; after what I have seen,
there is no dispute but that devil who came into my
chamber possesses me, and fills my imagination full
of all these visions.</p>
<p>The caliph, who saw him all the time, and heard
<span class="pb" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
these exclamations, almost killed himself with laughing;
and had much ado to forbear bursting out into
so loud a laughter, that the false caliph must have
heard him.</p>
<p>Afterwards Abon Hassan laid himself down again,
and shutting his eyes, the same lady said again, Since
your majesty does not rise, after we have, according
to our duty, told you it was day, and the dispatch of
business requires your presence, we shall use the liberty
you give us in such like cases. Then taking
him by one arm, and calling to one of the other ladies
to do the same by the other, they lifted him up, and
carried him into the middle of the hall, where they set
him on his breech, and all taking hands, danced round
him while the music played.</p>
<p>Abon Hassan was in an inexpressible perplexity of
mind, and said, What! am I indeed caliph, and commander
of the faithful? and in the uncertainty he was
in, would have said something more, but the music was
so loud that he could not be heard. At last he made
a sign to two of the ladies who were dancing, that he
wanted to speak with them; upon which they forbore,
and went to him. Do not lie, now, said he, but
tell me truly who I am.</p>
<p>Commander of the Faithful, replied one of the ladies,
your majesty would either surprise us by asking this
question, or else you must have had some very extraordinary
dream to-night; which may very well be,
considering that your majesty has slept longer to-night
than ordinary: however, if you will give me leave, I
will refresh your memory with what passed yesterday.
Then she told him how he went to the council, punished
the iman and the four old men, and sent a present
by his grand vizier, of a thousand pieces of gold,
to the mother of one Abon Hassan: after that, continued
she, your majesty dined in the three halls, and,
in the fourth, did us the honour to make us sit down
<span class="pb" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
by you, to hear our songs, and receive wine from our
hands, till your majesty fell so fast asleep, that you
never awaked, contrary to custom, before day. All
your slaves and officers can confirm what I say; and
it is now time you should go to prayers.</p>
<p>Very well, replied Abon Hassan, shaking his head,
you would have me believe all this but I can tell
you, you are all fools or mad; and that is a great pity,
for you are very handsome: for I can tell you, that
since I saw you, I have been at home, where I used
my mother so ill, that they sent me to a mad-house,
and kept me three weeks, and beat me every day with
a bull&rsquo;s pizzle; and yet you would make me believe
all this to be a dream. Commander of the Faithful
answered the lady, we are all ready to swear by what
your majesty holds most dear, that all you tell is a
dream; for you never stirred out of this hall since
yesterday, but slept here all night long.</p>
<p>The confidence with which the lady assured Abon
Hassan that all she said was truth, and that he had
never been out of the hall since that time, made him
not to know what to believe, but bewildered his senses.
O Heaven! said he to himself, am I Abon Hassan,
or the commander of the faithful? Almighty God, enlighten
my understanding, and inform me of the truth.
Then he bared his shoulders, and showed the ladies
the livid weals. Look, and judge, said he, whether
these strokes could come to me in a dream, or when
I was asleep. For my part, I can affirm that they
were real blows; for I feel the smart of them yet, and
that is a testimonial there is no room to doubt of.
Now, if I received these strokes in my sleep, it is the
most surprising and extraordinary thing in the world,
and what I cannot understand.</p>
<p>In this uncertainty, Abon Hassan called to one of
the officers that stood round him: Come hither, said
he, and bite the tip of my ear, that I may know whether
<span class="pb" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
I am asleep or awake. The officer obeyed him,
and bit so hard that he made him cry out horridly:
the music struck up at the same time, and the officers
and ladies all began to dance, and skip about Abon
Hassan, and made such a noise, that he was in a perfect
enthusiasm, and played a thousand merry tricks.
He tore off his caliph&rsquo;s habit, threw off his turban,
and jumped up in his shirt and drawers, and taking
hold of two of the ladies&rsquo; hands, fell a-dancing and
singing, and jumping and cutting capers, that the caliph
could not contain himself, but burst into so violent
a laughter at this sudden pleasantry of Abon
Hassan&rsquo;s, that he fell backwards, and made a greater
noise than the musicians and all of them together,
and lay in that condition for some time. At last he
got up again, and putting out his head, cried out,
Abon Hassan, Abon Hassan, what! have you a mind
to kill me with laughing?</p>
<p>As soon as the caliph&rsquo;s voice was heard, every body
was silent, and Abon Hassan among the rest; who,
turning his head to see from whence the voice came,
knew the caliph and the Moussel merchant, but was
not in the least dashed; but, on the contrary, found
that he was awake, and all that had happened to him
was matter of fact, and not a dream. He entered into
the caliph&rsquo;s pleasantry and intentions: Ha! ha!
said he, looking at him with a good assurance, you
are a merchant of Moussel, and complain that I would
kill you, who have been the occasion of my using my
mother so ill, and being sent to a mad-house. It was
you who treated the iman and the four scheiks in the
manner they were used, and not I; I wash my hands
of it. It was you who have been the cause of all my
disorders: in short, you are the aggressor, and I the
injured person.</p>
<p>Indeed you are in the right of it, Abon Hassan, answered
the caliph, laughing all the while; but to
<span class="pb" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
comfort thee, and make thee amends for all thy troubles,
I call Heaven to witness, I am ready and willing
to make thee what reparation thou pleasest to ask.
After these words, he came out of the closet into the
hall, and ordered one of his most magnificent habits
to be brought, and commanded the ladies to dress
Abon Hassan in it; and when they had done so, he
said, embracing him, Thou art my brother; ask what
thou wilt, and thou shalt have it.</p>
<p>Commander of the Faithful, replied Abon Hassan,
I beg of your majesty to do me the favour to tell me
what you did to disturb my brain in that manner, and
what was your design; for that is a thing of the
greatest importance for me to know, that I may perfectly
recover my senses.</p>
<p>The caliph promised to give him that satisfaction,
and said, First you ought to know, that I often disguise
myself, and particularly at night, to observe
what irregularities are committed in Bagdad; besides,
I set apart the first day of every month to make
a tour about it, sometimes on one side and sometimes
on another, but always return by the bridge.
That evening that you invited me to supper, I had
been taking my rounds; and in our discourse you told
me, that the only thing you wished for was to be caliph
for four and twenty hours, to punish the iman of
your mosque and his four counsellors. I fancied that
this desire of thine would afford me a great deal of
diversion, and thought immediately how I might procure
thee that satisfaction. I had about me a certain
powder, which throws immediately the person that
takes it into a sound sleep for such a time. I put a
dose of it, without being perceived by thee, into the
last glass I presented to thee; upon which you fell
fast asleep, and I ordered my slave to carry you to
my palace, and came away without shutting the door.
<span class="pb" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
I have no occasion to repeat what happened at my
palace when you waked: but after you had been regaled
all day, one of the slaves, by my order, put
another dose of the same powder at night into a glass
she gave you; you fell asleep as before, and the same
slave carried you home, and left the door open. You
told me all that happened to you afterwards. I never
imagined that you could have suffered so much as you
have done. But as I have a great regard for you, I
will make you amends; and that you may have no
cause to remember your ill treatment, think of what
would please you, and ask me boldly for it.</p>
<p>Commander of the Faithful, replied Abon Hassan,
how great soever my tortures may have been, they
were all blotted out of my remembrance, as soon as
I understood my sovereign lord had any share in
them, and doubt not in the least of your majesty&rsquo;s
bounty; but as interest had never any sway over me,
and I have the liberty to ask a favour, I beg that it
may be that of having access to your person, to have
the happiness of admiring, all my life-time, your
grandeur.</p>
<p>This last proof of Abon Hassan&rsquo;s generosity completed
the esteem the caliph had entertained for him.
I am mightily pleased with thy request, said the caliph,
and grant thee free access to my person at all
times and all hours. In short, he assigned him an
apartment in the palace; and, in regard to his pension,
told him, that he would not have him to have any
thing to do with his treasurer, but to come always to
him for an order upon him. Abon Hassan made a
low bow, and the caliph left him to go to council.</p>
<p>Abon Hassan made use of this time to go and inform
his mother of his good fortune, and what had
happened, which, he told her, was not a dream; for
that he had actually been caliph, and had acted as
<span class="pb" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
such, and received all the honours; and that she had
no reason to doubt of it, since he had it confirmed, by
the caliph himself.</p>
<p>It was not long before this new story of Abon Hassan
was spread all about Bagdad, and was carried
into all the provinces both far and near, and not one
single circumstance scarce omitted.</p>
<p>The new favourite Abon Hassan was always with
the caliph; for as he was a man of a pleasant temper,
and created mirth by all his words and actions, the
caliph could not live without him, and often carried
him along with him to see his spouse Zobeide, to
whom he told his story, and who was mightily pleased
with him, and observed that every time he came with
the caliph he had his eyes always fixed upon one of
her slaves, called Nouz-hatoul-aonadat, (which is to
say, Renewed Pleasure,) and resolved to tell the caliph
of it. Commander of the Faithful, said that
princess one day, you do not observe so well as I,
that every time Abon Hassan attends you in your
visits to me, he never keeps his eyes off Nouz-hatoul-aonadat,
and makes her blush, which is almost a certain
sign that she entertains no aversion for him. If
you approve of it, we will make a match between
them.</p>
<p>Madam, replied the caliph, you put me in mind of
a thing which I ought to have done before now. I
know Abon Hassan&rsquo;s taste of marriage from himself,
and have always promised him a wife that should
please him. I am glad you mentioned it, for I know
not how I came to forget it. But it is better that
Abon Hassan has followed his own inclination, and
chose for himself; and if Nouz-hatoul-aonadat is not
averse to it, we ought not to hesitate upon their marriage;
and since they are both present, let them declare
that they give consent.</p>
<p>Abon Hassan threw himself at the caliph&rsquo;s and
<span class="pb" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
Zobeide&rsquo;s feet, to show the sense he had of their
bounty; and, rising up, said, I cannot receive a wife
from better hands, but dare not hope that Nouz-hatoul-aonadat
will give me hers. After these words,
he looked upon the princess&rsquo;s slave, who showed, by
her respectful silence, and the sudden blush that rose
in her cheeks, that she was disposed to obey the caliph
and her mistress Zobeide.</p>
<p>The marriage was solemnized, and the nuptials celebrated
in the palace, with great rejoicings, which
lasted several days. Zobeide, in respect to the caliph,
made her slave considerable presents, and the
caliph did the same to Abon Hassan. The bride was
conducted to the apartment the caliph had assigned
Abon Hassan, who waited for her with all the impatience
of a bridegroom, and received her with the
sounding of trumpets and all sorts of instruments,
which played in concert, and made the air echo again
their sweet and harmonious notes.</p>
<p>After these feasts and rejoicings, which lasted several
days, the new-married couple were left to pursue
their loves peaceably. Abon Hassan and his
spouse were charmed with each other, and lived together
in perfect union, and seldom were asunder,
but when either he paid his respects to the caliph, or
she to Zobeide. Indeed Nouz-hatoul-aonadat was
endued with all the qualifications capable of gaining
Abon Hassan&rsquo;s love and attachment, and was just
such a wife as he desired; therefore they could want
nothing to render their lives agreeable. They always
ate the nicest and choicest rarities in season, and had
the best meats tossed up in fricasees and ragouts, &amp;c.
by an excellent cook, who took upon him to provide
every thing. Their beaufet was always stored with
exquisite wines. At dinner they enjoyed themselves
in this manner, and afterwards entertained each other
with some pleasantry or other: and in the evenings,
<span class="pb" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
which they consecrated to mirth, they had generally
some slight repast of dried sweetmeats, choice
fruits, and other light meats, and invited each other
by songs and catches to drink, and sometimes played
to their voices on a lute, or other instruments which
they could touch.</p>
<p>Abon Hassan and Nouz-hatoul-aonadat lived a
long time in this manner, when the caterer, who disbursed
the money for these expenses, put them in
mind that he had gone his length, and parted with all
his money; which they found, but too late, to be so
considerable a sum, that all the presents that the caliph
and the princess Zobeide had given them at their
marriage, were but just enough to pay him. This
made them reflect on what was past, and which at
that time they could not remedy. However, they
agreed to pay the cook; and sent for him, and paid
him all they owed him, without showing the least
trouble.</p>
<p>The caterer went away very well pleased to receive
so large a sum of money, though Abon Hassan and
his wife were not so over-well satisfied with seeing
the bottom of their purse, but remained a long time
silent and very much embarrassed, to find themselves
reduced to that condition the first year of their marriage.
Abon Hassan remembered very well that the
caliph, when he took him into the palace, promised
never to let him want any thing. But when he considered
how prodigal he had been of his money in so
short a time, he was unwilling to expose himself to
the shame of telling the caliph the ill use he had made
of what he had given him, and that he wanted more.
Besides, he had made over his patrimony to his mother,
as soon as the caliph had received him nigh his
person; and was afraid to go to her, lest she should
find that he had returned to the same extravagance he
had been guilty of after his father&rsquo;s death. His wife,
<span class="pb" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
on the other hand, looked upon Zobeide&rsquo;s generosity,
and the liberty she had given her to marry, as more
than a sufficient recompense for her service, and
thought she could not ask any more.</p>
<p>Abon Hassan at last broke silence, and looking
upon his wife, said, I see you are in the same embarrassment
as myself, and am thinking what we must do
in this unhappy juncture. I do not know what your
sentiments may be; but mine are, let what will happen,
not to retrench our expenses in the least; and, I
believe you will come into my opinion: the point is,
how to support them without asking the caliph or Zobeide;
and I fancy I have thought on the means: but
we must both assist each other.</p>
<p>This discourse of Abon Hassan&rsquo;s very much pleased
his wife, and gave her great hopes. I was thinking
so as well as you, said she; but durst not explain my
thoughts, because I did not know how to help ourselves;
and must confess, that what you tell me gives
me a great deal of pleasure. But since you say you
have found out a way, and my assistance is necessary,
you need but to tell me, and I will do all that lies in
my power.</p>
<p>I believe, replied Abon Hassan, that you will not
fail in this affair, which concerns us both; and therefore
I must tell you this want of money has made me
think of a trick we will put upon the caliph and Zobeide,
and at which, I am sure, they will both be
pleased, and be diverted with the cheat; which is,
you and I will both die. Not I indeed, interrupted
Nouz-hatoul-aonadat; you may die by yourself, if you
will. I am not so weary of this life; and whether
you are pleased or not, will not die so soon. If you
have nothing else to propose than that, you may do it
by yourself; for I shall not meddle with it.</p>
<p>You are so quick and hasty, replied Abon Hassan,
that you will not give me time to explain my meaning:
<span class="pb" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
have but a little patience, and you shall find that
you will be ready enough; for sure you did not think
I meant a real death. Well, said his wife, if it is but
sham death you design, I am at your service, and
you may depend on my zeal: but I must tell you
truly, I am very unwilling to die as I apprehended
you meant at first.</p>
<p>Be but easy a little, said Abon Hassan, and I will
tell you what I propose. I will feign myself dead,
and you shall lay me out on a white sheet, in the middle
of my chamber, with my feet towards Mecca, and
my turban upon my face, just ready to be buried.
When you have done so, you must cry and take on,
as is usual in such cases, and tear your clothes, and
with your hair loose about your ears, go to Zobeide.
The princess will ask you the cause of your grief; and
when you have told her, with words intermixed with
sighs, she will pity you, and give you some money to
defray the expense of my funeral, and a piece of gold
brocade, to cover my body with, that my interment
may be the more magnificent, and to make you a
habit in the room of that you had torn; and as soon
as you return with the money and the brocade, I will
get up and lay you in my place, and go and act the
same part with the caliph as you have done with Zobeide;
and I dare say the caliph will be as generous
to me as Zobeide will be to you.</p>
<p>Nouz-hatoul-aonadat liked this project very well,
and said to Abon Hassan, Come, lose no time; strip
to your shirt and breeches, while I prepare a sheet.
Abon Hassan did as his wife bade him, and laid himself
all along on his back, with his feet towards Mecca,
on the sheet which his wife spread on the carpet, just
in the middle of the room. As soon as he had crossed
his arms, his wife wrapped him up, and put a fine
piece of muslin and his turban upon his face. After
this, she pulled her hair over her face, and with a dismal
<span class="pb" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
crying and lamentation, ran across the court of
Zobeide&rsquo;s apartment; who, hearing the voice of a
person crying very loud, commanded some of her
women to see who it was, who returned, and told her
that it was Nouz-hatoul-aonadat, who was coming in
a deplorable condition.</p>
<p>The princess, impatient to know what had happened
to her, rose up immediately, and went to meet
her at the door of the antechamber. Nouz-hatoul-aonadat
played her part excellently well. As soon
as she saw Zobeide, she redoubled her cries, tore her
hair off by handfuls, beat her face and breast, and
threw herself at her feet, bathing them with her
tears.</p>
<p>Zobeide, amazed to see her slave in so extraordinary
an affliction, asked her, what misfortune had
happened to her. But, instead of answering, she continued
sighing and sobbing; and at last, feigning to
strive to check herself, said, with words intermixed
with sighs, Alas! my most honoured lady and mistress,
what greater misfortune could have befallen
me than this, which obliges me to throw myself at
your highness&rsquo;s feet? May God prolong your days,
my most respectable princess, in perfect health, and
grant you many happy years. Abon Hassan! poor
Abon Hassan! whom you honoured with your esteem,
and gave me for a husband, is no more!</p>
<p>Then Nouz-hatoul-aonadat redoubled her tears and
sighs, and threw herself again at the princess&rsquo;s feet.
Zobeide was extremely surprised at this news. Abon
Hassan dead! cried she, that agreeable pleasant
man! indeed I did not in the least expect his death
so soon; he seemed to promise a long life, and well
deserved one. Then she burst out also into tears, as
did all her women, who had been often witnesses of
Abon Hassan&rsquo;s pleasantries, when the caliph brought
him to see the princess Zobeide, and continued a long
<span class="pb" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
time bewailing the loss of him. At last Zobeide
broke silence, and ordered one of her slaves to go to
her treasure, and fetch a hundred pieces of gold, and
a piece of rich brocade.</p>
<p>The slave returned soon with a purse and piece of
brocade, which, by Zobeide&rsquo;s order, she put into
Nouz-hatoul-aonadat&rsquo;s hand; who threw herself
again at the princess&rsquo;s feet, and thanked her with a
great deal of satisfaction, to think she had succeeded
so well. Go, said Zobeide, make use of that brocade
to cover the corpse of thy husband, and with that
money bury him handsomely, and as he ought to be.
Moderate the transports of thy affliction: I will take
care of thee.</p>
<p>As soon as Nouz-hatoul-aonadat got out of the
princess&rsquo;s presence, she dried up her tears, and returned
with joy to Abon Hassan, to give him an account
of her good success. When she came into her
own apartment, and saw her husband still stretched
out in the middle of the floor, she ran to him laughing,
and bade him rise, and see the fruits of his project.
Upon which he arose, and rejoiced with his
wife at the sight of the purse and brocade, who, for
her part, could, not contain herself. Come, husband,
said she laughing, let me act the dead part, and see
if you can manage the caliph as well as I have done
Zobeide.</p>
<p>This is the temper of all women, replied Abon
Hassan, who, we may well say, have always the vanity
to believe they can do things better than men,
though, at the same time, what they do is by their
advice. It would be odd indeed, if I, who laid this
plot myself, could not carry it on likewise. But let
us lose no time in idle discourse: lie down in my
place, and see if I do not come off with as much applause.</p>
<p>Abon Hassan wrapped up his wife as she had done
<span class="pb" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
him; and with his turban undone, and set awry on
his head, and like a man in the greatest affliction imaginable,
he ran to the caliph, who was holding a private
council with the grand vizier Giafar and some
other viziers, and he having free access wheresoever
he was, went with his handkerchief before his eyes,
to hide the feigned tears which trickled down his
cheeks, and striking his breast with the other, expressed
an extraordinary grief.</p>
<p>The caliph, who was ever used to see Abon Hassan
gay and merry, was very much surprised to behold him
in that sorrowful state, and asked him the cause of
his grief. Commander of the Faithful, answered Abon
Hassan, with repeated sighings and sobbings, may
God preserve your majesty on the throne, which you
fill so gloriously! Alas! Nouz-hatoul-aonadat, whom
you in your bounty gave me for a wife, is &mdash;&mdash;. At
this exclamation, Abon Hassan pretended to have
his heart so full that he could not utter one syllable
more, but poured forth a flood of tears.</p>
<p>The caliph, who presently understood that Abon
Hassan came to tell him of the death of his wife,
seemed very much concerned, and said to him, God
comfort thee; she was a good slave, and we gave her
to thee with an intention to make thee happy: she
deserved a longer life. Then the tears ran down his
face, so that he was obliged to pull out his handkerchief
to wipe them off. In short, Abon Hassan dissembled
so well, that the caliph, who did not in the
least doubt of his sincerity, ordered his treasurer, who
was then present, to give Abon Hassan a purse of a
hundred pieces of gold, and a piece of brocade. Abon
Hassan immediately cast himself at the caliph&rsquo;s feet,
and thanked him for his present. Follow the treasurer,
said that monarch; throw the brocade over the
corpse, and with the money show the last testimony
of thy love for thy wife.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_325">[325]</div>
<p>Abon Hassan made no reply to these obliging words
of the caliph, but retired with a low bow, and followed
the treasurer; and as soon as he had got the purse
and piece of brocade, went home, very well pleased
with having found out so quick and ready a way of
supplying his necessity, which had given him some
trouble.</p>
<p>Nouz-hatoul-aonadat, weary with lying so long in
that posture, never waited till Abon Hassan bade her
rise; but as soon as she heard the door open, got up
and ran to her husband, and asked him if he had
cheated the caliph as well as she did Zobeide? You
see, said he, showing her the stuff, and shaking the
purse, that I can act a sorrowful husband as well as you
can an afflicted wife. But for fear this trick of theirs
should be attended with some ill consequences, he
thought it would not be amiss to instruct his wife with
what might happen, that they might act in concert.
For, added he, the better we succeed in embarrassing
the caliph and Zobeide, the more they will be pleased
at last, and perhaps may show their satisfaction by a
greater liberality. And this last consideration induced
them to carry on this scene further.</p>
<p>The caliph, though he had a great deal of business
to transact in council, was nevertheless so impatient
to go and condole with the princess upon the death of
her slave, that he rose up as soon as Abon Hassan was
gone, and put off the council to another day. Follow
me, said he to Mesrour, who always attended him
wherever he went, and let us go and share with the
princess the grief which the death of her slave Nouz-hatoul-aonadat
causes her.</p>
<p>Accordingly, they went to Zobeide&rsquo;s apartment,
whom the caliph found seated on a sofa, very much
afflicted, and all in tears. Madam, said the caliph,
going up to her, it is necessary to tell you how much
I partake with you in your affliction; since you are not
<span class="pb" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
insensible that what gives you pleasure or trouble,
has the same effect on me. But we are all mortals,
and must surrender up to God that life he gives us,
when he requires it. Nouz-hatoul-aonadat, your faithful
slave, was endued with qualifications that deserved
all your esteem, and I do not disapprove your expressing
it after her death; but consider, all your
grief will not bring her to life again. Therefore,
madam, if you love me, and would take my advice,
be comforted for this loss, and take care of a life
which you know is precious to me.</p>
<p>If the princess was charmed with these tender sentiments
which the caliph expressed in his compliments,
she was much more amazed to hear of Nouz-hatoul-aonadat&rsquo;s
death. This news put her into so great a
surprise, that she was not able to return an answer
for some time. At last, recovering, she said, Commander
of the Faithful, I am very sensible of all your
tender sentiments; but cannot comprehend the news
you tell me of the death of my slave, who is in perfect
health. My affliction is for the death of Abon Hassan,
her husband, your favourite, whom you was so kind
to let me know, who often diverted me very agreeably,
and for whom I have as great a value as you
yourself. But, sir, the little concern you show for
his death, and your so soon forgetting a man in whom
you have often told me you took a great deal of pleasure,
amazes and surprises me very much; and this
insensibility seems the greater, by your changing his
death for that of my slave.</p>
<p>The caliph, who thought that he was perfectly well
informed of the death of the slave, and had just reason
to believe so, because he had both seen and heard
Abon Hassan, fell a-laughing and shrugging up his
shoulders, to hear Zobeide talk after this manner.
Mesrour, said he, turning himself about to that
eunuch, what dost thou think of the princess&rsquo;s discourse?
<span class="pb" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
Do not women sometimes lose their senses?
for, in short, thou hast heard and seen all as well as
myself. Then turning about to Zobeide, Madam, said
he, do not shed any more tears for Abon Hassan, for
I can assure you he is well; but rather bewail the death
of your dear slave. It is not many moments since her
husband came all in tears, and the most inexpressible
affliction, to tell me of the death of his wife. I gave
him a purse of a hundred pieces of gold, and a
piece of brocade, to comfort him, and bury her with;
and Mesrour here, who was by, can tell you the
same.</p>
<p>The princess took this discourse of the caliph to be
all a jest, and that he had a mind to impose upon her
credulity. Commander of the Faithful, replied she,
though you are used to banter, I must tell you this is
not a proper time. What I tell you is very serious:
I do not talk of my slave&rsquo;s death, but of Abon Hassan
her husband&rsquo;s, whose fate I bewail, and so ought you
too. Madam, said the caliph, putting on a grave
countenance, I tell you, without raillery, that you are
deceived; Nouz-hatoul-aonadat is dead, and Abon
Hassan is alive, and in perfect health.</p>
<p>Zobeide was very much piqued at this answer of
the caliph. Commander of the Faithful, replied she
smartly, surely you would make me think that you
were mad; give me leave to repeat to you once more
that it is Abon Hassan who is dead, and that my
slave Nouz-hatoul-aonadat is living; it is not an hour
ago since she went from hence; she came here in so
disconsolate a state, that the sight of her was enough
to have drawn tears from my eyes, if she had not told
me her affliction. All my women, who cried with me,
can bear me witness, and tell you also, that I made
her a present of a hundred pieces of gold, and a
piece of brocade; and the grief which you found me
in was upon the death of her husband; and just that
<span class="pb" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
instant that you came in, I was going to send you a
compliment of condolence.</p>
<p>At these words of Zobeide, the caliph cried out, in
a fit of laughter, This, madam, is a strange piece of
obstinacy; but, continued he seriously, you may depend
upon Nouz-hatoul-aonadat&rsquo;s being dead. I tell
you not, sir, replied Zobeide instantly; it is Abon
Hassan that is dead, and you shall never make me
believe otherwise.</p>
<p>Upon this the caliph began to be angry, and set
himself upon a sofa, some distance from the princess,
and, speaking to Mesrour, said, Go immediately, and
see which it is, and bring me word; for though I
am certain that it is Nouz-hatoul-aonadat, I would
rather take this way, than be any longer obstinately
positive. For my part, replied Zobeide, I know very
well that I am in the right, and you will find it to be
Abon Hassan. And for mine, replied the caliph, I
am so sure that it is Nouz-hatoul-aonadat, that I
will lay you what wager you will that Abon Hassan
is well.</p>
<p>Do not think to come off there, said Zobeide: I
accept of your wager, and I am so well persuaded of
his death, that I would willingly lay the dearest thing
in the world to me. You know what I have in my
disposal, and what I value most; propose the bet,
and I will stand to it.</p>
<p>Since it is come to that, said the caliph, I will
lay my garden of pleasures against your palace of
paintings, though the one is worth much more than
the other. It is no matter for that, replied Zobeide;
if your garden is more valuable, you have made choice
of what you thought fit, and what belonged to me, as
an equivalent against what you lay; and I say done
to the wager, and will not turn back. The caliph
said the same, and both waited until Mesrour returned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_329">[329]</div>
<p>While the caliph and Zobeide were disputing so
earnestly, and with so much heat, Abon Hassan, who
foresaw their difference, was very attentive to whatever
might happen. As soon as he perceived Mesrour
through a window, over against which he sat,
talking with his wife, and observed that he was coming
directly to their apartment, he presently guessed
what he was coming about, and bade his wife make
haste to act the dead part once more, as they had
agreed on; and, in short, they were so pinched for
time, that Abon Hassan had much ado to wrap up his
wife, and lay the piece of brocade upon her, before
Mesrour came. As soon as he had done that, he
opened the door of his apartment, and with a melancholy
dejected countenance, and his handkerchief
before his eyes, went and sat down at the head of the
pretended deceased.</p>
<p>By that time he was seated Mesrour came into the
room. The dismal sight that saluted his eyes gave
him a secret joy, on account of the errand the caliph
sent him on. As soon as Abon Hassan perceived
him, he rose up to meet him, and kissing his hand
out of respect, said, sighing and groaning, You see
me, sir, in the greatest affliction that ever could befall
me; the death of my wife Nouz-hatoul-aonadat,
whom you honoured with your favours.</p>
<p>Mesrour, softened by this discourse, could not refuse
some tears to the memory of the deceased. He
lifted up the pall a little at the head, which was uncovered,
and peeping under it, let it down again, and
said, with a deep sigh, There is no other god but
God; we must all submit to his will, and return to
him. Nouz-hatoul-aonadat, my good sister, added
he, thy days have been very few: God have mercy
on thee. Then turning to Abon Hassan, who was all
the time in tears, We may well say, said he, that
women sometimes have whims, and lose their senses;
<span class="pb" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
for Zobeide will maintain to the caliph, that you are
dead, and not your wife; and whatever the caliph
can say to the contrary, he cannot persuade her otherwise.
He called me to witness the truth of what he
affirms; for you know I was by when you came and
told him the sorrowful news: but all signifies nothing;
they are both positive; and the caliph, to convince
Zobeide, has sent me to know the truth; but I fear
I shall not be believed; for when women once take
a thing, they are not to be beat out of it.</p>
<p>God keep the commander of the faithful in the
right use of his senses, replied Abon Hassan, still
sighing and crying; you see how it is, and that I have
not imposed upon his majesty; and I wish to heaven,
continued he, to dissemble the better, that I had no
occasion to tell him the melancholy and afflicting
news. Alas! I cannot enough express my irreparable
loss. That is true, replied Mesrour; and I can
assure you, I have a great share in your affliction;
but you must comfort, and not abandon yourself to
your grief. I leave you against my will, to return to
the caliph; but I beg the favour of you not to bury
the corpse until I come again, for I will assist at the
interment.</p>
<p>Abon Hassan waited on him to the door, and told
him that he did not deserve the honour that he did
him; and for fear Mesrour should return to say something
else to him, he followed him with his eyes for
some time, and then returned to his wife, and unloosed
her. This is already, said he, a new scene of
mirth; but I fancy it will not be the last; for certainly
the princess Zobeide will not believe Mesrour,
but laugh at him, since she has too substantial a reason
to the contrary; therefore we must expect some
new event. Whilst Abon Hassan and Nouz-hatoul-aonadat
were talking thus, she had time enough to
put on her clothes again; and both went and sat down
<span class="pb" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
on a sofa, opposite to the window, where they could
see all that passed.</p>
<p>In the mean time, Mesrour reached Zobeide&rsquo;s
apartment, and going into her closet laughing, clapped
his hands, like one who had something very agreeable
to tell.</p>
<p>The caliph, who was naturally impatient, would
presently be informed of the truth of the matter; for
he was piqued a little at the princess&rsquo;s diffidence:
therefore, as soon as he saw Mesrour, Vile slave, said
he, is this a time to laugh? Why do you not tell me
which is dead, the wife or the husband?</p>
<p>Commander of the Faithful, answered Mesrour,
putting on a serious countenance, it is Nouz-hatoul-aonadat
who is dead; for the loss of whom Abon
Hassan is as much afflicted as when he appeared before
your majesty. The caliph, not giving him time
to pursue his story, interrupted him, and cried out,
laughing heartily, Good news; Zobeide was a moment
ago mistress of the palace of paintings, which she
staked against my garden of pleasures, since you
went, and now it is mine; therefore thou couldst not
have done me a greater pleasure: but give me a true
account of what thou sawest.</p>
<p>Commander of the Faithful, said Mesrour, when I
came to Abon Hassan&rsquo;s apartments, I found the door
open, and he bewailing the death of his wife Nouz-hatoul-aonadat.
He was seated at the head of the deceased,
who was laid out in the middle of the room,
with her feet towards Mecca, and was covered with
that piece of brocade which your majesty made a present
of to Abon Hassan. After I had expressed the
share I had in his grief, I went and lifted up the pall
at the head, and knew Nouz-hatoul-aonadat, though
her face was very much swelled. I exhorted Abon
Hassan the best I could to comfort himself; and when
I came away, I told him I would attend at his wife&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
funeral, and desired him not to stir the corpse till I
came. This is all I can tell your majesty. I ask no
more, said the caliph, laughing heartily; and I am
very well satisfied with thy exactness. Then addressing
himself to Zobeide, Well, madam, said he,
have you yet any thing to say against so certain a
truth? Will you always believe that Nouz-hatoul-aonadat
is alive, and that Abon Hassan is dead? And
will you not own that you have lost your wager?</p>
<p>How, sir, replied Zobeide, who would not believe
one word Mesrour said, do you think that I regard
that impertinent slave, who knows not what he says?
I am not so blind or mad. With these eyes I saw
Nouz-hatoul-aonadat in the greatest affliction: I
spoke to her myself, and she told me that her husband
was dead.</p>
<p>Madam, replied Mesrour, I swear to you by your
own life, and that of the commander of the faithful,
which are both dear to me, that Nouz-hatoul-aonadat
is dead, and Abon Hassan is living.</p>
<p>Thou art a base despicable slave, said Zobeide, in
a rage, and I will confound thee immediately; and
thereupon she called her women, by clapping her
hands together, who all came in. Come hither, said
the princess to them, and speak the truth: Who was
that who came and spoke with me a little before the
caliph came here? The women all answered, that it
was poor afflicted Nouz-hatoul-aonadat. And what,
added she, addressing herself to her that was treasurer,
did I order you to give her? Madam, answered
the treasurer, I gave Nouz-hatoul-aonadat, by your
orders, a purse of a hundred pieces of gold, and a
piece of brocade, which she carried along with her.
Well then, sorry slave, said Zobeide to Mesrour, in a
great passion, what hast thou to say to all this? What
dost thou think now, that I ought to believe thee, or
my treasurer, my other women, or myself?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_333">[333]</div>
<p>Mesrour did not want for arguments to contradict
the princess; but, as he was afraid of provoking her
too much, he chose rather to be silent, though he
was satisfied within himself that the wife was dead,
and not the husband.</p>
<p>All the time of this dispute between Zobeide and
Mesrour, the caliph, who heard what was said on both
sides, and was against the princess, because he had
seen and spoke to Abon Hassan himself, laughed
heartily to see Zobeide so exasperated against Mesrour.
Madam, said he to Zobeide, I know not indeed
who was the author of that saying, That women sometimes
lose their wits; but I am sure you make it good.
Mesrour came just now from Abon Hassan&rsquo;s, and
tells you that he saw Nouz-hatoul-aonadat lying dead
in the middle of the room, Abon Hassan alive, and
sitting by her; and yet you will not believe this
evidence, which nobody can reasonably refuse: I
think it is very strange.</p>
<p>Zobeide would not hear what the caliph represented.
Pardon me, Commander of the Faithful, replied
she, if I suspect you: I see very well that you
have contrived with Mesrour to chagrin me, and try
my patience. And as I perceive that this report was
concerted between you, I beg leave to send a person
to Abon Hassan&rsquo;s, to know whether or no I am in
the wrong.</p>
<p>The caliph consented, and the princess charged an
old nurse, who had lived a long time with her, with
that important commission. Hark ye, nurse, said
she, you see the dispute between the caliph and me;
therefore go to Abon Hassan&rsquo;s, or rather Nouz-hatoul-aonadat&rsquo;s,
for he is dead, and clear up this
matter. If thou bringest me good news, a handsome
present is thy reward. Make haste and return quickly.</p>
<p>The caliph was overjoyed to see Zobeide in this
embarrassment; but Mesrour, extremely mortified to
find the princess so angry with him, did all he could
<span class="pb" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
to appease her, insomuch that she and the caliph
were both satisfied with him. He was overjoyed
when Zobeide sent the nurse; because he was persuaded
that the report she would make would agree
with his, and would justify him, and restore him
to her favour.</p>
<p>In the mean time, Abon Hassan, who watched the
window, perceived the nurse at a distance, and guessing
that she was sent by Zobeide, called his wife, and told
her that the princess&rsquo;s nurse was coming to know the
truth; therefore, said he, make haste and lay me out.
Accordingly Nouz-hatoul-aonadat did so, and covered
him with the piece of brocade Zobeide had given her,
and put his turban upon his face. The nurse, eager
to acquit herself of her commission, came a good
round pace, and entering the room, perceived Nouz-hatoul-aonadat
all in tears, her hair dishevelled, and
seated at the head of her husband, beating her breast,
and expressing a violent grief.</p>
<p>The good old nurse went directly to the false widow.
My dear Nouz-hatoul-aonadat, said she, with
a sorrowful face, I come not to interrupt your grief and
tears for a husband who loved you so tenderly. Ah!
good mother, replied the counterfeit widow, you see
my misfortune, and how unhappy I am by the loss of
my beloved Abon Hassan. Abon Hassan, my dear
husband! cried she, what have I done that you should
leave me so soon? Have I not always rather obeyed
your will than my own? Alas! what will become of
poor Nouz-hatoul-aonadat?</p>
<p>The nurse was in a great surprise to see every
thing quite the reverse of what the chief of the eunuchs
had told the caliph. This black-faced Mesrour,
said she, lifting up her hands, deserves to be impaled
for having made so great a difference between my
good mistress and the commander of the faithful, by
the notorious lie he told them. I will tell you daughter,
said she, the wickedness of that villain Mesrour,
<span class="pb" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
who has asserted, with an inconceivable impudence,
before my mistress&rsquo;s face, that you were dead, and
Abon Hassan was alive.</p>
<p>Alas! my good mother, cried Nouz-hatoul-aonadat,
I wish to heaven that it was true! I should not be in
this sorrowful state, nor bewail a husband so dear to
me. At these words she burst out into tears, and
feigned a most desperate trouble.</p>
<p>The nurse was so much concerned for her tears,
that she sat down by her, and cried too: then gently
lifting up the turban and cloth, looked on the face of
the corpse. Ah! poor Abon Hassan, cried she, covering
the face again, God have mercy upon thee. Adieu,
child, said she to Nouz-hatoul-aonadat; if I could
stay longer with you, I would, with all my heart: but
I am obliged to return immediately, to free my mistress
from the uneasiness that black villain has given
her by his impudent lie, assuring her with an oath
that you was dead.</p>
<p>As soon as the nurse was gone, and had pulled the
door after her, and Nouz-hatoul-aonadat thought she
would not come back again, she wiped her eyes, and
went and unloosed Abon Hassan, and then both went
and sat down on a sofa against the window, expecting
what would be the end of this cheat, and to be ready
to act according as things should offer.</p>
<p>The nurse, in the mean time, made all the haste
she could to Zobeide. The pleasure of carrying the
princess good news, and hopes of a good reward,
added wings to her feet; and running into the princess&rsquo;s
closet, quite out of breath, there gave her a true
account of all she had seen. Zobeide hearkened to
the old woman&rsquo;s relation with a most sensible pleasure;
and when she had done, she said, Repeat it
once more before the caliph, who looked upon us all
to be fools, and would make us believe we have no
sense of religion, nor fear of God; and tell your story
<span class="pb" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
to that wicked black slave, who had the insolence to
assert a falsity, and which I know to be one.</p>
<p>Mesrour, who expected the nurse&rsquo;s report would
prove favourable on his side, was very much mortified
to find it so much the contrary. He was so vexed at
the rage Zobeide expressed against him, for a thing
he believed to be very true, that he was glad of having
an opportunity of speaking his mind freely to the
nurse, which he durst not do to the princess. Old
toothless, said he to the nurse, thou tellest lies, and
there is no truth in what thou sayest; for I saw Nouz-hatoul-aonadat,
with these eyes, laid out in the midst
of the room.</p>
<p>Thou art a notorious liar thyself, replied the nurse,
with an insulting air, to dare to maintain before my
face so great a falsity, since I saw Abon Hassan dead,
and laid out, and left his wife alive. Thou art an
impostor, replied Mesrour, and endeavourest to put
us all into confusion.</p>
<p>There is impudence for you, said the nurse, to dare
to tell me I lie, in the presence of their majesties,
when I saw just now, with my own eyes, what I have
had the honour to tell them. Indeed, nurse, answered
Mesrour again, you had better hold your tongue, for
you certainly dote.</p>
<p>Zobeide, who could not support this want of respect
in Mesrour, who, without any regard to her,
treated her nurse injuriously, without giving the nurse
time to reply to so gross an affront, said to the caliph,
Commander of the Faithful, I demand justice for this
insolence in our presence; and could say no more,
she was so enraged, and burst out into tears.</p>
<p>The caliph, who had heard all this dispute, thought
it very intricate, and mused some time, and could not
tell what to think of so many contradictions. The
princess, for her part, as well as Mesrour, the nurse,
and all the women slaves who were present, were as
<span class="pb" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
much puzzled, and remained silent. At last the caliph
taking up the cudgels, and addressing himself to
Zobeide, said, I see very well we are all liars; myself
first, and then you, Mesrour, and your nurse; or at
least it seems not one can be believed before the
other: therefore, let us go ourselves to know the
truth; for I can see no other way to clear up these
doubts.</p>
<p>After these words the caliph got up, the princess
followed him, and Mesrour went before to open the
doors. Commander of the Faithful, said he, I am
overjoyed that your majesty has taken this course,
and much more, when I shall make it plainly appear
that the nurse dotes, though the expression is displeasing
to my good mistress.</p>
<p>The nurse, who wanted not to reply, said, Hold thy
tongue, black face; thou dotest thyself.</p>
<p>Zobeide, who was very much provoked at Mesrour,
could not bear to hear him attack her nurse again
without taking her part. Vile slave, said she, say
what thou wilt, I maintain my nurse is in the right,
and look upon thee as a liar. Madam, replied Mesrour,
if the nurse is so very certain that Nouz-hatoul-aonadat
is alive, and Abon Hassan is dead, I will lay
her what she dare of it. The nurse was as ready as
he; and, in short, they laid a piece of gold and silver
stuff.</p>
<p>The apartment the caliph and Zobeide came out
of, though it was a great way from Abon Hassan&rsquo;s,
was nevertheless just over against it, and Abon Hassan
could perceive them coming, and told his wife,
that the caliph and Zobeide, preceded by Mesrour,
and followed by a great number of women, were
coming to do them the honour of a visit. At this news
she seemed frightened, and cried out, What shall we
do? we are ruined! Fear nothing, replied Abon Hassan:
What! have you forgot what we agreed on? We
<span class="pb" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
will both be dead, and you shall see all will go well.
At the slow rate they come, we shall be ready before
that time they get to the door. Accordingly Abon
Hassan and his wife wrapped up and covered themselves
with the piece of brocade, and waited patiently
for their visitors.</p>
<p>Mesrour, who came first, opened the door, and the
caliph and Zobeide, followed by their attendants,
entered the room; but were extremely surprised, and
stood motionless, at the dismal sight which saluted
their eyes. At last, Zobeide breaking silence, said to
the caliph, Alas! they are both dead! You have done
finely, continued she, looking at the caliph and Mesrour,
to endeavour to make me believe that my slave
was dead; and I find it true at last: it is dangerous
jesting with edge-tools: the grief of losing her husband
has certainly killed her. Say rather, madam,
answered the caliph, prepossessed to the contrary, that
Nouz-hatoul-aonadat died first, and the afflicted Abon
Hassan could not survive his dear wife: therefore you
ought to agree that you have lost your wager, and
your palace of paintings is mine.</p>
<p>Hold there, answered Zobeide, animated with the
same spirit of contradiction; I will maintain it, you
have lost your garden of pleasures to me. Abon Hassan
died first; since my nurse told you, as well as me,
that she saw her alive, and crying for the death of her
husband.</p>
<p>The dispute of the caliph and Zobeide brought on
another between Mesrour and the nurse, who had
wagered as well as they; and each pretended to win,
and came at last to abuse each other very grossly.</p>
<p>After all, the caliph reflecting on what had passed,
began to think that Zobeide had as much reason as
himself to maintain that she had won. In the embarrassment
he was, of not being able to find out the
truth, he advanced towards the two corpses, and sat
<span class="pb" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
himself down at the head, searching after something
that might gain him the victory over Zobeide. Well,
cried he, presently after, I swear, by the holy name of
God, that I will give a thousand pieces of gold to him
that can tell me which of these two died first.</p>
<p>No sooner were these words out of the caliph&rsquo;s
mouth, but he heard a voice under Abon Hassan&rsquo;s
pall, say, Commander of the Faithful, I died first,
give me the thousand pieces of gold. At the same
time he saw Abon Hassan throw off the piece of brocade,
and come and prostrate himself at his feet,
while his wife did the same to Zobeide, keeping on
her pall of brocade, out of decency. The princess at
first shrieked out, and frightened all about her; but
recovering herself at last, expressed a great joy to see
her slave rise again alive. Ah! wicked Nouz-hatoul-aonadat,
cried she, what affliction have I been in for
thy sake! However, I forgive thee from my heart,
and am glad to see thee well.</p>
<p>The caliph, for his part, was not so much surprised
when he heard Abon Hassan&rsquo;s voice; but thought he
should have died away with laughing at this unravelling
of the mystery, and to hear Abon Hassan ask so
seriously for the thousand pieces of gold. What,
Abon Hassan, said he, hast thou conspired against my
life, to kill me a second time with laughing? How
came this thought into your head, to surprise Zobeide
and me thus, when we least thought on such a
trick?</p>
<p>Commander of the Faithful, replied Abon Hassan,
I will declare to your majesty the whole truth, without
the least reserve. Your majesty knows very well,
that I always loved to eat and drink well; and the
wife you gave me rather increased than restrained
that inclination. With these dispositions, your majesty
may easily suppose we might spend a good
estate; and, to make short of my story, we were not
<span class="pb" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
the least sparing of what your majesty so generously
gave us. This morning, accounting with our caterer,
who took care to provide every thing for us, and paying
what we owed him, we found we had nothing
left. Then reflections of what was past, and resolutions
to manage better for the future, crowded into
our thoughts apace, and after them a thousand projects,
all which we refused. At last, the shame of
being reduced to so low a condition, and not daring to
tell your majesty, made us contrive this trick to relieve
our necessities, and to divert your majesty, hoping
that you would be pleased to pardon us.</p>
<p>The caliph and Zobeide were very well satisfied
with Abon Hassan&rsquo;s sincerity; and then Zobeide, who
had all along been very serious, began to laugh, and
could not help thinking of Abon Hassan&rsquo;s scheme;
when the caliph, who had laughed his sides sore at
the singularity of this adventure, rising up, said, Follow
me both of you, and I will give you the thousand
pieces of gold I promised you. Zobeide desired him
to let her make her slave a present of that sum. By
this means Abon Hassan and his dear wife Nouz-hatoul-aonadat
preserved the favour of the caliph
Haroun Alraschid and the princess Zobeide; and by
their liberalities were made capable of pursuing their
pleasures.</p>
